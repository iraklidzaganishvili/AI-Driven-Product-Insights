When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how sharp and ready to use it was. The sheath is well-made with belt loops and a carry handle, making it convenient for carrying in a backpack. However, it would have been even better if the inside of the sheath had a plastic lining to prevent damage from repeated removal and insertion of the hatchet. Despite that minor flaw, I believe that with careful handling, the sheath will last a long time. The hatchet bit itself was perfectly sharpened. Considering its price point, I give it 5 stars. Hopefully, this review will be helpful to someone.</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-replay-cont py-5 px-4 mb-20 bg-white radius-5"><div class="d-flex comment-cont"><div class="inf"><div class="title d-flex justify-content-between"><h6 class="fw-bold">Rephrased comment</h6><div class="time  text-uppercase d-inline-block"><div class="rate"></div></div></div><div class="text color-000  mt-10">The axe is incredibly lightweight and well-balanced, with a super sharp edge right out of the box. Although I didn't like the generic bubble wrap packaging and the useless sliced up rubber band as an edge guard, overall it's an excellent axe for its $15 price tag. It would be nice if they included the cheap nylon sheath that their other axes come with, but it's not a deal breaker considering the price. Personally, I prefer leather sheaths anyway. You can't go wrong with this purchase and I would definitely buy it again. Thanks!</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-replay-cont py-5 px-4 mb-20 bg-white radius-5"><div class="d-flex comment-cont"><div class="inf"><div class="title d-flex justify-content-between"><h6 class="fw-bold">Blade cover needs improvement</h6><div class="time  text-uppercase d-inline-block"><div class="rate"></div></div></div><div class="text color-000  mt-10">The blade cover is made of thin stretch rubbery plastic and arrived already split in 2 places. It cannot be relied upon for protection or safety for the axehead blade. I had to find an alternative solution by using cardboard from the shipping box and silver duct tape to create a sleeve for the axehead. The blade also requires treatment/sharpening before it can be properly used. Despite these issues, the weight and balance of the axe are great, making it a worthwhile purchase especially when on sale at $14.99.</div></div></div></div></div>
