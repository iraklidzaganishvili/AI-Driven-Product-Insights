They found it to be well-manufactured and comparable to their favorite tumblers. The inner steel is well-formed and easy to clean due to the large size of the jug. The rubber foot on the bottom provides friction and protection, while the top has a washer/gasket to keep liquid inside. The flip spout works well. Additionally, they appreciated that the jug comes with a carrying case, which will protect it from impacts. Overall, they were satisfied with the surface finish of the jug.</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-replay-cont py-5 px-4 mb-20 bg-white radius-5"><div class="d-flex comment-cont"><div class="inf"><div class="title d-flex justify-content-between"><h6 class="fw-bold">Positive Review of Konokyo Insulated Jug</h6><div class="time  text-uppercase d-inline-block"><div class="rate"></div></div></div><div class="text color-000  mt-10">The reviewer highly recommends the Konokyo brand for their insulated water bottles and jugs.
