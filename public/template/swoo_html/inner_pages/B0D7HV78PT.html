I returned the S24 Plus for this Pixel because the sharp corners and weight of the S24 Ultra were too much for me, so I sold it on eBay. Thanks to Amazon's excellent return policy, I'm now enjoying my Pixel! The YouTube reviews overlook some important aspects; I'm using Nova Launcher with it. This phone is incredibly smooth with perfect animations. It feels great in hand—well-built but not overly heavy or large—similar in size to the S24 Plus but more rounded and comfortable. The haptic feedback is unparalleled and integrated throughout the OS, providing a fantastic experience that allows me to type better than on an iPhone due to its smart keyboard features. The operating system is clean without duplicate Samsung apps or account confusion that can lead to chaos. The speakers outperform Samsung’s by far, delivering perfectly balanced sound with bass instead of being tinny like theirs; speakerphone functionality works well too. Its build quality matches Apple's standards while offering a stunning screen display. As for the camera? It's ranked #2 among all mobile cameras according to Dxo reviews—with even the iPhone 16 Pro rated lower—and there's no shutter lag like there is with Samsung devices; it captures images flawlessly every time thanks to Google Snap Seed app and AI features that elevate photography experiences significantly. Interestingly enough, I had a logical conversation about Buffalo Bills' season with my phone—it was surreal! Go Bills! Additionally, this device stays cool during use and charges quickly as well; concerns regarding its Tensor 4 chip are exaggerated since it's super fast daily without any issues whatsoever along with impressive battery life and seamless Android Auto performance—the OS always seems one step ahead of me! With RFC now adopted by Apple iMessage, this truly is 'the' phone you should get! P.S.: Prepare yourself for mind-blowing camera capabilities!!! Goodbye Samsung and Apple—hello Pixel!</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-replay-cont py-5 px-4 mb-20 bg-white radius-5"><div class="d-flex comment-cont"><div class="inf"><div class="title d-flex justify-content-between"><h6 class="fw-bold">Pixel 9 Pro XL lives up to the expectations</h6><div class="time  text-uppercase d-inline-block"><div class="rate"></div></div></div><div class="text color-000  mt-10">I've been using the Pixel 9 Pro XL for a week now, and after extensive testing, I'm really pleased with my decision. Just to clarify, I’m an everyday user (not a professional reviewer) and purchased this phone myself without any sponsorship or freebies. I believe that many of the criticisms regarding this 9th generation Pixel come from individuals who haven't actually owned one (Verified Purchase?). This phone is fantastic. Everything functions smoothly and efficiently. It’s quick and responsive; while Samsung and Apple flagship models may excel in benchmarks, in practical use, this device manages everything I've thrown at it effortlessly. And it's in real-world scenarios where this phone truly excels. Coming from Samsung, I found their cluttered UI and pre-installed apps unappealing. The Pixel offers the cleanest Android experience possible, which is evident as everything operates intuitively and effectively. It's been quite some time since I've used an iPhone regularly, but if you're someone who thinks of iPhones as the ultimate 'just works' devices, you should definitely consider this phone. If you favor Google's ecosystem (Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar), then the Pixel is your best bet—everything integrates seamlessly without unnecessary bloat or complicated workarounds found on other phones.I've heard concerns about achieving maximum charging speeds unless you invest in the pricey Google charger; however, I charge mine wirelessly overnight while sleeping using even a budget-friendly wireless charger—it charges adequately well! It appears that to achieve 37-watt charging speed requires specific chargers that can boost voltage; so if rapid charging is crucial for you during busy days perhaps opt for Google's official wired charger or do thorough research on compatible chargers yourself.But personally speaking? Charging speed isn't critical for me given its large battery capacity—it lasts all day long under heavy usage from dawn till dusk without needing a midday recharge between 5 am to 10 pm! As long as it holds up throughout my day until nighttime when I plug it back in—that's what matters most regardless of whether it takes longer than usual to fully charge! But that's ultimately your choice.The camera quality is outstanding—capturing some of the finest photos I've seen from any smartphone out there! While there are numerous options available for photo editing post-capture having features like Video Boost or Zoom Enhance integrated directly into Photos makes photography enjoyable right off-the-bat! Challenge anyone else out there finding simpler workflows yielding top-notch images because if instant results matter along with ease-of-use—this phone delivers beautifully too! Of course additional third-party editing applications await just one download away—but honestly they might not be necessary.I understand Google promotes AI heavily but truthfully that's not why I chose this device so I'll leave detailed AI evaluations up others instead—for fun Magic Editor provides entertainment value &amp; Zoom Enhance pushes boundaries within mobile photography yet certain aspects such as Gemini Live feel somewhat incomplete overall despite being significant advancements by Google itself—the AI feels disjointed overall though still promising future improvements ahead...Gemini Live doesn’t interact seamlessly alongside regular Gemini either which adds confusion especially considering basic tasks require switching back/forth between them making things cumbersome at times too...It also puzzles me how fundamental functionalities offered through Assistant remain inaccessible via Gemini altogether—which seems like something simple enough yet remains complex currently…These annoyances are minor hiccups hopefully rectified soon enough—but hey—to Google: If hyping up AIs please ensure smoother integration rather than leaving users frustrated over inconsistencies present today because highlighting these features only amplifies existing flaws noticed thus far…AI technology evolves rapidly though so maybe these critiques will become irrelevant shortly thereafter anyway—and again since AI wasn’t my main reason behind purchasing—I don’t see it negatively impacting my experience whatsoever.I’ll keep everyone posted should anything arise down line—but presently couldn’t be happier with purchase made here being first-time owner among Pixels seeing why fans exist surrounding brand loyalty established already across community circles alike…This particular model may not cater perfectly towards every individual need/desire nor intended purpose therein…but nevertheless worth exploring nonetheless offering premium quality combined aesthetics performing exceptionally well across board—all-around solid option deserving attention amidst crowded smartphone market landscape today!</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-replay-cont py-5 px-4 mb-20 bg-white radius-5"><div class="d-flex comment-cont"><div class="inf"><div class="title d-flex justify-content-between"><h6 class="fw-bold">So far, so good.</h6><div class="time  text-uppercase d-inline-block"><div class="rate"></div></div></div><div class="text color-000  mt-10">I have received my Pixel 9 Pro XL and have been using it for a few days now. Up to this point, I am very pleased with the phone. It has replaced my Sony Xperia 1III, but since Sony hasn't released their latest flagship in the US, I was eager to try out the Pixel. So far, I haven't encountered any negatives and will update my review as I continue to use it. This feedback comes after just a few days of usage and transitioning from Sony. The setup process was SMOOTH; everything transferred seamlessly from my old device, leaving me to customize it as desired. The display is stunning—extremely bright with excellent contrast. The software experience is superb; it's a clean version of Android that I'm enjoying.For me personally, camera quality on smartphones is crucial and this one has met my expectations based on limited testing so far. I've tried the add me feature successfully and found macro focus to be an exceptional addition that I'll frequently utilize for close-up shots. Telephoto images appear slightly soft; however, I'd like to test them with some stabilization (like a tripod or monopod) to determine if user movement affects clarity rather than lens performance. I do miss the Sony camera software because it provided an SLR-like experience within a smartphone which I'm still adjusting away from here—but I'm quickly getting accustomed! I'm excited about discovering more features of both the camera software and hardware.The battery life easily exceeds a day even under heavy usage conditions. Charging with the 45w Google charger took only 45 minutes to go from 5% to 75%, which is impressive! I've noticed that this phone performs exceptionally well speed-wise compared to all other devices in my home (computers, iPads, phones), achieving by FAR the best Speedtest results on our home wifi—it’s not even comparable! Face unlock and fingerprint recognition work flawlessly.A number of reviewers have commented on build quality and aesthetics—I recall handling an earlier pixel model (possibly around four years ago?) thinking it felt light and somewhat "toyish." That perception does NOT apply here at all—the design feels beautiful and substantial in hand! Transitioning from the Sony 1 III doesn’t make this phone feel oversized or overly heavy.I’m giving it five stars for these reasons.</div></div></div></div></div>
