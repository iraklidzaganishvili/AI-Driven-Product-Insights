        "content": "One of the main reasons I purchased these bottles was because Amazon backed them with a one-year warranty. They carry the Amazon Brand and specifically state they have a year warranty.Fast forward 4 months and the lid breaks making the bottle unusable. No problem right? There’s even a link to product support. But wait, the link takes you a BROKEN link - nothing there. So I call Amazon customer service (basically out of I’m just upset at the dishonesty of it all) and they put me on hold, ask me if I’ll take a $5 credit, put me on hold, they argue that it doesn’t say 1 year warranty (yep, it’s there currently on your website).Word of device. DONT TRUST AMAZON BASICS WARRANTY.It’s a cheap bottle, they don’t stand behind their product. Buy a better brand."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "We like this water bottle for its convenience.  It is well-made and has stood up to a bit of bashing around without any problems.  The only drawback is that the lid opens by pressing a bar at the front of the lid.  If anything touches that spot, the lid opens up and water spills out.  Learned that the hard way!  However, there is a locking slide that prevents that, though I had a tiny amount of water spill out when I knocked it over with the lid locked.  For cleaning, I put it in the top shelf of my dishwasher."

        "content": "I really liked the design of this- that the lip of the bottle is part of the bottle.  It makes it easier to clean in comparison to the style where the lip is part of the top that's a separate piece and has silicone o-rings.  However, after using them for more than a year, I'm finally fed up with the leaks.  The lid will unlatch even if its \"locked\".  And the silicone stopped for the mouth of the bottle doesn't always seal well.  Too finicky for me! I'm finding something else."
