Google’s AI-powered image processing really impressive. The battery easily lasts a full day, even with heavy use. It’s definitely a premium phone, but worth it for the performance, camera, and long-term support. Highly recommend!"

        "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "This phone is evidence of the tech worlds deep overselling of AI. Out of the box, the gestures to swap between open apps on your phone and close them is virtually unusable. The gesture to circle something and Google search it, that's what's easy. Screen capture on a button on the side? Nope, launch the AI assistant, which is just the old assistant with a new name. Fortunately you can bring back the virtual buttons in the settings, rendering the phone almost functional.Just not for voice mail or MMS messages which I keep receiving errors on. Custom support chat can't even be bothered to read what you tell them so you have to type it three times, and their solutions just don't work. Up next on my list? Spending hours on the phone with their customer support.The phone feels great, but it's so slick, it slid from the center of a hardcover book (library book with the protective cover) off my side table with no force applied. Case is a must for grip. Even for flat surfaces apparently.This phone was a big jump for me from a Pixel 3 to a Pixel 9 and so far, nothing about the 9 is impressive outside of the fact that it made it through the day with battery to spare. When I got my 3 I was blown away. What I got a few days ago is unimpressive for six full years of development time.For the cost and the time jump. I wanted to be wowed. I was not wowed. The phone still takes good photos, you get good volume out of the speakers, although I think I liked the tone of my 3 better. Oh well, maybe in another 6-7 years Google will make a phone that functions better in its fundamentals instead of chasing unnecessary features in response to fragile tech trends."

        "content": "I'm returning it because it's so expensive, buying it was an impulsive decision and now days later I realize I'm out of $800 bucks, it's not worth it because I can get other similar-ish phones for way much less. The battery is great as well as the speed. Love the refresh rate, however the phone does heat up when on for long periods of time. Sound quality great, screen size OK -- I miss small phones. Overall great phone, but it's too expensive, so I'm returning it. ☹️"
