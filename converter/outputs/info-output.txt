        "content": "Love my iron flask water bottle. It came with three different lids that you can change out, along with extra straws and cleaning brushes. I picked this size because it still fits in the car drink holder (and in backpack water bottle holders), but also has a wide enough mouth for easy cleaning. Haven't had any issues with leaking, and the bottle has held up well (I've banged it around a bit at the gym and transporting in the car). I typically use it for cold water (with ice cubes added), and water stays cold for a pretty long time; haven't tried it with anything warm though. I've bought a few bottles from this company - worth it!"

The quality is amazing and great for people always on the run. I love the wide array of color and design selections. Just got myself the 40 oz and pleased to say it is just as good. This brand really cares about their buyers. Gave me 2 straws 3 different compact lids and a sticker. I will never go to a different brand, this would be a perfect gift for everyone in your family. Amazing product I will also share with my family."

He hasn't used it for anything hot so I can't speak on that but I can't imagine it wouldn't keep things hot for a long time. He loves the straw but will swap it out on occasion. It's easy to open and easy to clean. It also seems incredibly durable. I even bought one for myself!"

        "content": "This is my third one. I got the ocean color. I love the 22 ounce size and when one bottle is dirty, I can swap it out for another clean one. I drink more water when I don’t have to drink it out of a giant bottle and this slim size is perfect for holding without it being too heavy or bulky.I love having lid options as I tend to swap between whatever I need. These are great to carry around with the handle lid. It keeps my drinks super cold. I don’t need to keep drink cold for 24-48 hours because I’m actually drinking my liquids frequently so I can’t say how long it holds the temps but I’m not complaining.I would’ve never bought three bottles with the major competitor prices but these are an excellent price for everything you get and they’re pretty durable."

        "content": "I was tired of hot water on my cycling rides,and prime day arrived and I ordered 2 20oz and 1 40oz bottle from iron flask. They arrived and I filled one 20 and the 40 with ice and water. 24 hours later and through various settings (in the jeep, garage, apartment, garage again...) there is still plenty of ice in the bottle and this makes me really happy. I've not had a chance to try the 20oz on a blisteringly hot ride, but I'm confident it will hold up just fine. (I'll update when I do)The accessories included are great and my favorite part is the built in clip on the sippy lid.My only thought is, why didn't the name and logo people go with Fe instead of just F on the logo?Otherwise, I like the finish, the built in straw and sippy lid work great and overall I'm really happy with this purchase.Drawback? Picking a color was daunting as there are so many to choose from.I'll be getting more for certain."

The paint has only chipped a tiny bit because I hand wash the bottle as directed (the paint chips are also from me dropping the bottle.)It keeps drinks cold for an incredibly long time. Yesterday I had it on me in 110 degree weather for hours and it still had some ice cubes intact at the end of the day.I ended up changing the lid a few times because someone in my family melted to original straw in the dishwasher . The lid it comes with doesn’t leak at all. I came back to buy more colors and sizes.This is just as good (if not better) than hydroflasks and Stanley’s for way less money. Buy it!"
