      "Hi. We make water bottles.",
      "Why? Well, we’re a motley crew of dreamers and designers who live by a simple creed: “Do more of what you love.”​",
      "And we love designing things that make life a little bit easier and a heckuva a lot more enjoyable. We asked ourselves, with so many different kinds of water bottles out there, why do 3 out of 4 people still suffer from chronic dehydration?",
      "So we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. We created what we believe to be the finest water bottles in all the land. Water bottles designed to help you do more of what you love. So, what are you waiting for? Go forth and carpe the diem—hydrated like a boss.",

      "FreeSip Spout",

        "content": "This water bottle is so unique like no other. Aside from keeping my drink cold for a long time, aside from the very colorful top that attracted me foremost ever since the first time I laid my eyes on it,  I love so much the sip and swig features - big spout opening and the unique sip hole that looks like a contour of a pursed lip. The big straw inside that is connected to it gives me the right size amount of drink, water in this case, when I have to take in a sip to drink some medication. Proven for its quality, last night, I placed a couple of lemon slices to my water inside and let it seep through overnight. This morning, when I took a sip, some of the lemon parts got stuck at the bottom end of the straw, preventing me to drink a good amount of my usual sip. It was no problem at all. That’s where the swig features comes in handy. I tilted my head and got a good gulp amount of water. Boy I just love this Owala. I love parading it at work, swinging and swaying it around with the easy lift and secure handle. No spill at all. 32 oz is the most perfect size for me. (Oh my, first time a wrote a long review. Sorry, can’t control myself, I just love this Owala)"

        "content": "Didn't know anything about the brand when buying, just thought the colors were cute and wanted to try it. Turns out the design is very well thought out, comes with a straw but also allows u to drink from it without the straw if you prefer (it's also satisfying because you always get that last drop of water out). The bottle is easy to grab even for people with smaller hands. Keeps the temperature of the water the same as when it was put in. The bottle fits into the side pouch of most backpacks, including my own which is a pretty tight fit. Only drawback is that it's a bit heavy but that's to be expected for a metal bottle filled with water."

        "content": "I recently purchased the Owala FreeSip water bottle and have been extremely happy with my purchase. The bottle is well-designed and easy to use. The FreeSip lid allows me to drink from the bottle without having to tilt my head back, which is great for when I'm driving or working at my desk. The lid is also leak-proof, so I don't have to worry about any spills. The bottle itself is made of durable stainless steel and keeps my water cold for hours. I also appreciate that the bottle is BPA-free and environmentally friendly. Overall, I highly recommend the Owala FreeSip water bottle to anyone in the market for a high-quality, functional water bottle."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "This is an easy one-handed push button to access the drinking area. I feel this keeps it sanitary. It has a straw that can detach to be cleaned. This allows you to sip to the straw or tilt the container up to drink. They do say not to use hot liquids for safety reasons. Pressure can build up. I haven't used it long-term, so I cannot comment on staining or ease of cleaning. It will mostly be used for water. It is keeping the water very cold for a long time. The only downside is that you have to close it for best performance on keeping liquids cold and not spilling if it gets knocked over-- I do tend to tip my water bottle over in the car or at the gym. Having to push the button every time is kind of inconvenient and I wonder about the longevity. However, everything else combined makes this a good choice."

Sippy part is like those mouth piece Gatorade bottles. Website says top is dishwasher safe (top rack) & straw works in silverware compartment. Love it!"

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "After years of owning Yeti bottles, I switched to this bottle mostly because my daughter told me about it.  What I found is that it’s the best designed of all the ones out there.We briefly tried the Stanley bottles with built in handles and straws. While those are good, I found carrying those around to be awkward, especially if I want to store them in a backpack.Enter Owala.  I own three sizes for different reasons. The 40oz is the one I use daily at home. It either sits next to the bed overnight or I use it for my work day.  The bottle keeps water cold for up to 48 hours.I also carry a 32oz for daily excursions. The 40oz is just too big for cup holders. The 32oz also keeps cold for up to two days. Finally, I have a 24oz that I use for travel.I love the spout.  The bottle allows me to drink however I feel necessary. Normally I use the built in straw, but there are times I’ve just wanted to chug water and their spout allows me to do both.The cap seals extremely well. We’ve had Yeti bottles leak, Owala seems to have solved this issue quite well.Now for the bad things…. If you fill the bottle with ice water, I suggest adding the ice last.  Putting ice in first causes it to stay in the lower section of the bottle, making it hard to get the straw into it. I usually fill my bottle with water, add ice and then push the straw through.Second, I had the flip top mechanism stick a bit on one bottle, which I promptly returned and replaced. Only happened on one out of the five we own in the house.Overall this is a highly recommended item that you will not regret."

        "title": "Best water bottle ever",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I have spent so much money on cheaper water bottles that don't work.  Especially straw types.  This straw is completely different.  It's \"mouth shaped\" at the top and SECURELY attached inside so it doesn't pop off like the cheap ones do.  It's also straight instead of curved so I get water all the way down to the bottom.  There is also a chug hole.  My only advice is don't forget it's there and tilt the bottle up to drink from the straw.  I did that once.  Whoops.  But the chug hole is a great feature too!  At dance classes I need more than a sip.  That being said -- the straw hole delivers a solid stream of water with minimal effort.  I did drop it and scraped some of the paint off yesterday, but all things considered, it was a hard drop and it barely dented.  I'd say it's pretty sturdy!  It is also attractive, sporting bright colors that make me smile when I look at it.  Honestly, I wish I had sprung for the $30 bucks a LOT sooner because I'm so happy with this water bottle.  I'd have to LOSE it to make me buy another one, which isn't so great for the company, but it's hard to need to replace perfection.  This is the perfect water bottle for me.  Oh -- and it doesn't leak when the lid is shut.  I was worried because I have an apple tag hooked to the locking portion, so I was afraid it would leak, but it does not.  If you aren't using the lock as a handle like I am, I would lock it to make it especially leak proof.  Happy drinking!!"

        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I love the Owala so much that I bought them for my whole family. They have both a straw and an opening to drink from and they are insulated so they keep water cold. My favorite thing about it is how fast you can drink from them. No glugging. The pop top is easy to undo one handed and the carrying ring snaps over the button so it won’t pop open when you don’t want it to.The only problem with these is it develops mold on the mouthpiece seal that you can’t clean off. I have a black line where it seals against the mouthpiece. I would buy a replacement seal if they sold them."

        "title": "Convenient, Great Design, Incredible For Everyday Use",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I love that the bottle has a large capacity (40 oz) but still fits well in backpack bottle holders (if it can hold a 32 oz Nalgene, it can hold the 40 oz Owala). The sipping straw feature built into the mouthpiece is surprisingly comfortable and very easy and convenient to use regardless if you're sipping or swigging. The design of the mouthpiece also makes it very easy to clean compared to other sipping bottles like a bite valve bottle. The stainless steel vacuum interior holds water temperature very well and is very easy to clean, especially with the wide mouth opening when the cap is removed. The cap secures very well and you can feel the tight seal when you close it, giving you confidence that it won't leak. The silicone seal for the mouthpiece also can be removed very easily for cleaning and the carrying handle folds in very well and locks in securely. Everything locks into place with a very satisfying, secure click.The one caveat, or limitation, of the bottle is that the seal on the mouth piece is so effective that it can cause the straw to store water when you remove the cap when the bottle is full. This may lead to some spillage from the end of the straw if the mouthpiece seal is opened after the removal of the straw. Also, when filling the bottle, be sure to replace the cap with the mouthpiece seal open or some water may shoot out of the mouthpiece when you open the seal as the water rushes into the straw when the air is released. In my opinion, this is a very minor issue.Overall, the bottle has quickly become my everyday water bottle. It fits into my bag's bottle pockets very well and is great for leaving on my desk at work to sip water from while also being great to take swigs from while at the gym, or when I'm especially thirsty. The simple design makes it easy to clean and the stainless steel interior holds temperature very well while being plastic free."

        "content": "I LOVE my Owala. Several months ago, I researched for HOURS on the best water bottle to get. I was gifted a Stanley but never liked it much since I'm a germaphobe and don't like the straw being exposed to the elements. A friend recommended her 32oz Owala, but I decided on the 24 since \"filling up more often\" really isn't a concern for me. I've had it for months now and it was definitely a perfect decision. The dual-use sip/chug spout is GENIUS and I definitely make use of both. It is very easy to clean, which i do at least weekly. I also bought a silicone boot to put on it, which I would recommend for anyone who is prone to dropping like me. I took hours to decide on a color, I ended up with the teal/orange/reddish one. Since getting this and using it around campus, I've seen TONS of other students/athletes using owalas, and even specifically in this color. Before a few weeks ago, I have never seen anyone on Tiktok/online/in person ever using this color. Not saying I started it, but...(jk, but definitely get the bottle)"
