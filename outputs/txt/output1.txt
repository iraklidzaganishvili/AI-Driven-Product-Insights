        "content": "This 16\" laptop has the most features, at the highest specs, for the lowest cost. I spent months reading reviews and comparisons to other laptops, and I decided on this model because it offered the best value. So if that is your primary concern, buy this laptop.I'm a creative entrepreneur who also games, so I needed a machine that could be fun while also making me money, yet without looking like a typical gamer laptop. The Nitro will play all of the latest games on Ultra and run them perfectly. The 4070 has 8 GB of VRAM, and in most situations this is plenty. There are a few games that require more for the highest quality textures, but you can toggle a different feature off to compensate, and it'll then run it at a high FPS. The DLSS and RTX on some games help it run even smoother.This laptop has excellent cooling, with multiple vents. The fans are not as loud as I thought they would be. In fact, when you use the included Nitro software, you can toggle it for everyday use and the fan is near-inaudible. There's an even quieter setting for absolute silence. The fan does get loud when playing a few intense games at max, but your headphones can block it out with in-game sound. The same is true for most desktop towers, and is the nature of gaming.The screen is excellent, with vivid colors, high brightness, a 165 Hz refresh rate, and a 16:10 ratio. The extra vertical height serves a valuable purpose when reading documents and editing images in graphic design programs. It's also pleasing to the eye. The thin bezels add to this appeal.Lots of connection ports. Fast Wi-Fi and ethernet. The keyboard is slightly squishy, but it's fine, and I use a full external keyboard anyway. The backlit keys are fun, useful, and can be modified in 4 zones, or turned off. The included webcam isn't stellar, but it works like you want it to.The only concern I had with this laptop is the 16 GB of RAM. They are high-speed sticks from Hynix, but when I multitasked in Photoshop, Chrome, and other editing programs, or while gaming at max settings, it would sometimes use 95% of the RAM. That's not a problem with the hardware, because RAM is designed to be utilized at its fullest for hours at a time, but I knew that I'd be doing simultaneous video and audio editing while browsing that would require more RAM, so I upgraded to 64 GB G.Skill RipJaws. It turns out that this was overkill, and I never utilize more than 32 GB. The 16 GB is fine for most creative people.Similar situation with the built-in SSD. It's a fast model Samsung, but I needed more space, so also upgraded the SSD from 1 TB to two 2 TB Samsung Pro 990s, to fit the extra m.2 drive bay. There is no third bay for a SATA SSD platter, as there was on the previous Nitro model.The laptop battery is huge, but this laptop supports USB-C charging. I purchased a 140 watt portable USB-C battery with a 240 watt cable. When plugged-in, this charger provides all of the necessary energy to run my applications and keep the battery at max. This lightweight charger makes trips to the library easier. However, once plugged in, Acer notifies me with a brief message that the laptop is not receiving the ideal amount of power. Unfortunately there are no 240 watt portable chargers available on the market at the moment. Some day soon they'll have 240 watt chargers and the larger brick will be obsolete.To conclude, this laptop can do everything you need a laptop to do, while also playing games at max, and it provides a tremendous value.---Here is the information I gathered about this machine, from various reviews and the internal readouts after owning it. I wish Acer added this to the sales page to have helped with my initial purchase, but since they didn't, here it is for you, to help with your decision.Acer Nitro 16 (AN16-41-R5KC) 2023Launched: January 2023.

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "Overall Build Quality: Laptop is nice and thicc. Thick plastic casing and has some weight to it. Screen is really nice and only thing I would say that's, \"wrong\" with it is the colors. Some pedant in these reviews mentioned the colors looking washed out on certain images. I've only noticed that once on some yellow background and it's so minimal I wouldn't knock any points for it. Because the screen is really nice. So nice in fact, that I now want to replace my 144hz 1080p monitor on my main PC. The keyboard is really nice too. When I'm casually gaming I'll use the laptops keyboard but I still prefer a nice ,clicky, mechanical keyboard. Speakers aren't super loud if that matters to you but they sound okay.Cooling: They used liquid metal on the CPU and GPU instead of thermal paste so the temperatures stay below 80 degrees Celsius without any additional cooling. The fans have only blasted one time for me and I was gaming without the laptop propped up. Overall, the laptop is very quiet and stays cool. Only issue with the liquid metal is it will be a pain to change out in the future and you might want to take it to a professional to replace for you.Battery: I'm able to do an entire session(8 hours) of Ableton music production on just battery life... Haven't tried recording yet but I'm not worried. The battery also charges very fast and lasts a long time, which is nice. I haven't tried gaming on battery life but maybe I will and add to review later.Gaming/Screen: 10/10 for gaming, what I would expect for a laptop at this price point and it delivers. No need for an external monitor, I'm able to play Counter Strike 2 on this laptop alone without issue. 165-185FPS at 2K but can probably improve a lot dropping to 1080p. There's obviously delay but visually unnoticeable. I played DOOM(2016) on Ultra at 2K resolution with steady 185FPS.Optimus: Laptop has advanced Optimus. You can also bypass Optimus altogether and have the laptop run solely on the 4060 GPU bypassing the IGPU. Very nice laptop."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "This Acer might be the best option for price to performance, right now. The 4060 and 7840hs are more than powerful enough to drive the 1920x1200 resolution at max settings, high refresh rate in every modern game I've tried out. It's really a perfectly balanced set-up, for spec, that should last quite a while. The laptop has solid build quality, stays pretty quiet in all but the Turbo setting (I generally just use Performance. Nearly the same clock/ CPU speeds, but fans aren't maxed out), and has great repairability/ upgradeability (just unscrew the bottom plate, pop it off, and everything is right there). The IPS screen is quite nice, and the extra vertical space you get with the 1920x1200 res, over standard 1920x1080 really benefits the viewing experience. Keyboard is pretty good, and the RGB is solid, if you're into that (I use it as key lighting primarily). Not a huge fan of touchpads without deparated mouse buttons, but this one is overall fine, I just use a usb mouse when I need it. Speakers aren't great (standard for laptops), but, the laptop comes stock with DTS:X, which makes a huge difference. It boosts the sound a ton, and adds a ton more depth and scope to the sound. I'd highly recommend keeping it installed, and running it. I don't even use headphones (as i normally would), it's so good. I've been able to play everything I own at max settings (modern games included), taking advantage of the 165hz Gsync panel. May have to enable DLSS, or frame gen, etc. when dealing with RTX, but the 4060 has it covered. Temps are awesome. In the heaviest loads, GPU maxes out around 70c and CPU gets to the 80s. Overall, I think it's an amazing value for a gaming set-up, and really well balanced in the spec department, and would easily recommend it"

I recommend everyone buy a gaming computer for people who do office work there is just so much more you get from a gamer than an office computer but you need at least 2tb hard drive for that. This only has 1.3. This is heavy..Manageable and remember the screen is 17 inches.. People who buy a gaming computer with 512 versus a 1 tb hard drive because it cheaper don't do it Windows takes up almost 200 of that. This Acer Nitro 17 is perfect not just for a gamer but a professionalWho needs to add a lot and needs the speed to do it.. When people talk about apple or intel integrated graphics will run the game don't listen to them.. Oh they will load but no way are they playable.That said In my opinion If you can get this computer (this one not the ones that get mixed in with other Acer computer reviews on Amazon)for under 1000 dollar...Buy...Buy...Buy!!  You will be very happy with it.."

        "content": "I bought this at the worst time.  I took a week to even unpack it, and then got sick, got put on some meds that knocked me out a week, and had surgery scheduled and didn't have as much time as anticipated to set it up.  I installed multiple versions of Linux on the machine, and the touchpad wouldn't work for any of them, even after much troubleshooting and diagnostics.  I finally broke down and installed Windows, still no touchpad.  But I had enough delays to push me outside the easy Amazon return window.  I think it is worth the tens of dollars to replace the touchpad myself and see if that works rather than deal with the manufacturer warranty.I didn't think it would be that big a deal.  I mostly use keyboard shortcuts and mostly use it as a desktop computer so I would use my trackball instead of the touchpad anyway.  Good thing, because this is a beefy computer.  I take it back and forth between my desk and my guitar practice area to record and display sheet music.  I forgot though that I do a ton of sports photography.  For serious edits, I am at my desk with a full keyboard and trackball.  But I do tend to cull and crop photos while watching a game or movie on the couch, and with the laptop being so large, it is not easy to set up the trackball.  I can't even imagine if you use a mouse.Other than that, it seems like a great computer.  The monitor is sharp, it is plenty powerful for the games I play (graphics rich, but not fast-twich).  I mostly bought it for doing video editing and mass photo processing, and it is noticeably faster than either my actual desktop or last laptop.  One thing I particularly like about this one is that you can use the USB-C to charge it.  Not fully - it won't keep up if you are keeping under load - but it does give extra lifetime, and if you mix in doing basic web browsing or document editing with loading the CPUs it can actually recover some charge.  Good thing, because as heavy as the laptop is, the power brick is HEAVY.  And since I use it as a desktop, it usually isn't trivial to unplug and dig out of where I've got it buried on my desk.  Most high powered laptops take the \"if USB-C can't fully replace the power brick, we won't bother to support PD at all\", but that is a nice little benefit to this one that it'll take any bit of power to keep the battery life extended."

        "content": "My 8-year old Acer Aspire Win10 laptop is still working, but is not capable of running Win11, and since support for Win10 ends next year, time to think of getting a new generation laptop. This new Acer Nitro 17 is a beast, and at a great Black Friday price. With the 17-in. display, RTX 4060 GPU , Ryzen 7 7840HS CPU, and 1TB SSD HD, this would be a really decent gaming laptop. I don't game, but this thing will be capable of equally-demanding video editing/transcoding or 3D modeling/engineering/design apps.  This laptop also comes in a variation using an Intel i7 CPU for about the same price, which made for a tough choice since both models of CPU are similar in performance. I ultimately went with this AMD processor because of slightly faster RAM speed and slightly lower power consumption, so hopefully it will run a little cooler as well. (But frankly, either CPU would be good).  This laptop boots up fast and runs like a champ, with a clear, sharp, and bright BIG-screen display (which also means a full size keyboard underneath); I'm thrilled with its performance. The jury is still out on Win11, but I guess that's something I'll get used to. The only upgrade I'm considering is doubling the RAM from 16 to 32 GB, and possibly a 2TB SSD if I ever get close to filling up the 1TB model already installed.  This is a GREAT large-screen laptop at a good price, especially if you can catch it on a price dip like Black Friday. I'm a big fan of Acer, and this laptop is highly recommended!EDIT:After 2 months, decided to double the RAM to 32GB after noticing Windows 11 utilized over 25% of total RAM capacity even when running at idle, not leaving much excess for really intensive apps or heavy multi-tasking. OEM RAM was (2x8GB) DDR5 5600CL46 by Hynix, a well-regarded brand.... YES, 5600MHz memory speed as opposed to the slower 4800MHz speed shown in the listing specs, which is a nice bonus. Several good brands to choose from for the RAM upgrade (Corsair, Crucial, Hynix, Patriot, Gskill, etc.), but one stood out. Kingston Fury 5600CL40 SODIMM's not only run at 5600MHZ speed, but also have better latency (CL40, as opposed to CL46 for the other brands). Price was reasonable as well (in fact, cheaper than most of the others; and co-incidentally, using chips made by OEM manufacturer Hynix), so I definitely recommend Kingston Fury RAM as an excellent upgrade for this AMD-based Nitro 17 laptop. CPU-Z utility shows the new RAM is working fine at 5600 MHz speed and CL40 latency rating. (see attached photos for before-and-after CPU-Z displays of RAM memory, 16GB old vs. 32GB new). Now when laptop is running at idle, Windows 11 only seems to use about 12% of RAM, leaving much more for app-related purposes, so everything should run more smoothly and quickly, even when doing intensive multi-tasking. This motherboard is capable of handling up to 64GB of total RAM, but from what I've read that much is overkill - an unnecessary expense and excessive RAM that will never get fully utilized. 32GB of RAM seems to be the sweet spot for maximum efficiency in this system. Makes this fantastic laptop even better than before!"

        "content": "The Nitro A17, with the Ryzen 7840 and the RTX 4060, is a great laptop, with tons of ports 3x USB A two of which are gen 3, 2x USB C gen 4 on the back, HDMI, and a micro SD card slot. It plays any game I can find at full no problem. It has loud fans when gaming and in turbo as you should expect. Though in quiet mode it is very quiet. You can use the HDMI to play shows and you will not hear it. The battery life varies widely depending on usage. I get between 3 and 5 hours. Though if I was using heavy gaming I would expect only 2 hours.  My only complaints so far after a few weeks of use is the seeming lack of USB C charging. The documents say one of the c ports is power in though the cable I hooked up seems not to work. And it is a USB C charger for a laptop. Second is the keyboard and touch pad,the touch pad is big and as such is easily hit while typing. Causing issues and the placement of the keys on the right side of the keyboard is not for me. I hit the wrong key so many times I bought a wireless keyboard mouse combo. All in all I for the cost I could not have gotten a better deal on it. And it provides me all the power I can use and more."

I can play WOW, COD, Diablo 4, Shatterline, Battlefield 2042 all on ultra settings and they look beautiful with frame rate from 60 to 100.  I did step the setting down by one just to keep the fan from running on full all the time. Battery life is as expected from a gaming laptop.  This laptop is not small but it weights 3 pound lighter the the predator laptop I replaced. Colors really pop on the QHD screen. I now have to upgrade my extra monitor because it does not look as good. Definitely love the Acer laptops, well worth the money spent.  I had to upgrade the wife's laptop as well so she does not steal mine.My only con is all the bloat ware that comes pre installed.  Easy enough to remove, just takes time."

        "content": "Explanation of pictures - Two computers side by side shows the bright colors of the Acer Nitro 17 display vs. my wife's Lenovo 5 Slim which I had considered but dismissed after seeing the display at a local retailer.  The other picture shows that my system came with DDR5 5600MHz vs. the 4800MHz it was advertised to have.  Bonus for me! :)A quick recap of why I ended up purchasing this computer.Unfortunately we are in a position of having to downsize dramatically and our desktop computers will be going in to storage.  My wife and I are both avid gamers, currently really in to playing Baldur's Gate 3 a couple times a week with some friends.I knew I needed something with enough grunt to play most any game I threw at it for at least 2-3 years, my previous experience with the 60 level (860M) GPU told me that this would be a good enough level to handle that want.  I needed to have a CPU that would be able to handle my day to day work, enough umph to handle games, be higher end to remain serviceable for a good few years, and be efficient.  My biggest want was a big vibrant display, followed by power port on the back, current gen ports (HDMI 2.1, USB 4 Type C, and USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A) , DDR5, and last but so far away from least would be build quality.GPU is handled by a Nvidia 4060 8GB (would have gone 4070 if they had a 12GB version, but all I could find was 8GB).  Performance different between the 4060 and 4070 is ~15%, not enough different to justify the price.  While looking at this there was an Asus ROG with a 12th Gen i7 and a 4070 but it was built on an outdated system board that only ran DDR4, the performance gains going from DDR4 3200 MHz to DDR5 4800MHz is about 6-7% which brings than GPU advantage in to check.  The CPU going to the Ryzen 7 7840 vs the 12th gen i7 gives about 5-7% as well.  So there goes most of the gains.  Sure some games won't be hindered by the loss of CPU or Memory and the 4070 will knock the 4060 back down, but as games get more advanced and more CPU intensive, I like having the extra grunt and the extra RAM speed.  That was my reasoning for staying with the less expensive 4060.CPU, I'm an AMD fanboy.  I have been for years.  Ever single desktop I've built since I started building have been AMD.  Started with AMD K5 P166 way back when.  Then K6 200, 233, K6-2, Duron, Athlon, Athlon XP, FX, Ryzen 7 1700, Ryzen 7  5700X, and now Ryzen 7 7840HS.  I opted for the Ryzen 7 over the Ryzen 5 (7640HS) which was available in a Lenovo I was comparing against, and interestingly enough the one my wife ended up with.  I know this CPU will handle what I need for a long while and be very efficient.Display.  Boy howdy, let me tell you this thing is gorgeous.  Bright (in the picture it is at 50% brightness and it looks just as bright as the Lenovo 5 Slim 16\" WUXGA display at 100%).  Color reproduction is great, not the best in the world but let's be real here... this laptop does not cost that much.  For a 17.3\" display that puts out this much eye melting beauty is a steal.  Blows away others that cost $500 more.  Just look at the picture.  Speaks for itself.RAM - 16GB, enough for now.  And by some hiccup mine came with 5600MHz DDR5 instead of the advertised 4800MHz.  I call that a win and it will surely help down the road.Build Quality - I was most worried about this and sort of still am.  I've owned HP, Lenovo, and Dell.  Never been happy with the HP.  Dell held up great.  My old Lenovo from 2014 was built like a tank and was what I held on to until I purchased this one.  That system had a 4th Gen i7, Nvidia 860M, and 16GB RAM.  It handled most things great until recently, it has been retired to being a garage computer.  It doesn't feel cheap.  The hinge is crazy tight.  The palm rest doesn't flex under weight unless you push really hard.  The keyboard doesn't dip while typing.  The display doesn't shake at all while typing.  Keyboard feels solid.  No missed keys while typing this long review. Touchpad is a little cheap, wish it were a bit more accurate or made of a more slippery material so my finger wouldn't skip while dragging slowly.  But let's be honest, I'm using a mouse when I do anything that required more precision than a touchpad can deliver.  Time will tell if it holds up.  The black plastic surface is a fingerprint magnet so keep a microfiber cloth for when you want to wipe it off.  With all of that being said I am purchasing the 4 Year extended warranty for this laptop which means I likely won't have to make a claim because that's how it goes with these things, you know what I'm saying.All in all, I really do like this computer.  I wasn't completely on board at first but after using it for a few days I am excited to spend the next few years gaming with this system.Before I close this out I would be doing you a disservice if I didn't say that yes this thing runs Baldur's Gate 3 butter smooth at full resolution (2560x1440).  Not a hiccup.  And it looks soooo good :).If you made it this far, thank you for reading my review."

        "content": "Despues de un mes de uso creo que ya puedo escribir una reseña mas completa de esta computadora. He visto muchas reseñas malas o tal vez sesgadas que pueden hacer que tengas miedo en comprar una pero voy a tratar de ser lo mas conciso posible. Amazon entrego el paquete super sellado y protegido, la caja viene con sellos de seguridad que te aseguran que la computadora no ha sido abierta antes por lo que es necesario que verifiquen esto. Dentro esta la caja de la pc con mas sellos de seguridad y la funda (la cual debo decir que es de muy buena calidad).En la caja vas a encontrar la laptop, su cargador (el cual es muy grande), manuales, stickers y una funda protectora para el equipo muy fina y una para el teclado, si quieres puedes conservarlas ya que mantienen a la pc sin polvo.Al encender la primera vez enciende muy lento, debo decir que espere como 15-20 minutos hasta que inicie la configuración de Windows 11. Se reinicio varias veces y la tuve conectada al cargador para poder iniciar. El inicio de windows 11 es muy intuitivo pero tambien tuve varios problemas de desconexión del wifi y ciertas cosas mas, es necesario actualizar la computadora y sus componentes para que de un buen rendimiento. Debe tardar entre 5-6 horas en terminar todo esto junto con las actualizaciones de varios componentes, creo que esta computadora no es para personas que no tengan cierto conocimiento en configuración de una pc pues te va a tomar tiempo y podrías pensar que tu equipo vino defectuoso cuando necesita algunas actualizaciones, no hay mucho soporte en YouTube sobre esto asi que debes guiarte descargando las actualizaciones que vienen en un codigo QR dentro de los manuales.Voy a enumerar los fallos que tuve antes de hacer todas las actualizaciones para que lo puedan tomar en cuenta:- Encendido lento- Pantalla azul win 11- Desconexion de la red wifi- Lentitud en la red- Los juegos iniciaban con los gráficos del procesador y no de la tarjeta gráficaUna vez hecho esto ya no tuve problemas, el ordenador se enciende en 7-8 segundos y se inicia en ese momento a pesar que tengo aplicaciones de inicio como Spotify o Wallpaper Engine.Para juegos diria que es de lo mejor que he tenido, puedes jugar con variedad de emuladores a 60 o mas fps. Corre prácticamente cualquier juego y no he tenido problemas de bajones, salvo en fortnite alguna vez pero muy aislada. En lo demás corre cualquier juego con gráficos altos.Lo unico malo que encontre es que si no te gusta el ruido de los ventiladores vas a tener un problema pues estos suenan mucho, pero lo puedes configurar con la aplicación de ACER Nitro y puedes hacer que funcionen para un perfil de juego o si solo es uso diario y no vas a jugar o ejecutar acciones que demanden la gráfica o el procesador. Otra cosa que puede molestar tal vez es la duración de la batería. Suele durar para multimedia y trabajo ligero entre 4-5 horas, si estas jugando o ejecutando tareas pesadas te puede durar entre 1 hora y media y 2 horas.El precio al que yo compre esta pc fue de 970, asi que por tener una rtx 4050 y un computador potente para mi trabajo de desarrollo de software me viene fenomenal. La verdad estoy muy contento con la compra y si la recomendaría pero teniendo en cuenta que debes tener un conocimiento básico para configurar y manejar un pc, en mi país esta pc esta en casi 2500 dólares asi que para mi fue una ganga.Espero haber abordado la mayoría de dudas y si pasa algo adicional o se puede mejorar la reseña pues volveré por aqui."
