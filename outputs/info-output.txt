        "content": "I was told about Thermoflask by a friend and it hasn't disappointed. If I fill the bottle 1/4 of the way with ice and add water to the top, the water has stayed cold for 24 hours. I haven't tried anything hot in it so I can't vouch for a drink remaining hot any length of time.  I like this particular size because it fits into my car cup holder which is where I usually am with it. There's a variety of colors to choose from and  each bottle comes with two different tops. I like mine so much I've purchased a couple extra as gifts."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I have never had a water bottle I liked so much. Ive never been the type of person that always has their water bottle with them, until now. I’ve been trying to drink 1 gallon water/day for a long time now and I’ve tried lots of different methods, but they were hard to carry out. With this water bottle, it’s somehow easier. I know that 5 of these, plus 1 more cup equals a gallon. So I do 5.5 of these per day. It’s easier than carrying around my gallon sized water bottle.The things I love about this:1. The shape of the handle is extremely natural to hold. It’s the perfect shape for your hand to grab.2. It insulates your drink super well.3. I love the color I chose lol. (Purple)4. It’s leak proof, so when I’m going to nurse my baby and getting all the things I want with me (water, phone, reading material, etc) I know I can just toss it on the bed or couch and no leaks will happen. I can also just throw it in the diaper bag without worrying.5. It fits in the car cup holders6. I prefer the straw lid. The straw is made of sturdy plastic and won’t deteriorate or look dirty and nasty like those rubbery clear plastic straws. Also, it’s fun to fidget with the straw, which in turn leads to me drinking more water lol.7. It’s skinny enough to grab easily with one hand.I love this water bottle!"

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "One of the best Amazon purchases I've ever made! It is really great quality! I like that you receive two lids; One with a straw and one with a screw top. I have been using the straw lid and love it. The silicone mouthpiece does come off for easy washing. I like to put ice in my water so if I use about 1c of ice, I can fit about 16oz of water into it. It keeps your drink cold all day too! I love that my son cant figure out how to open it (kid gets into everything! Lol!) and that its spillproof. It's a great water bottle! Not too heavy at all. It fits in the cup holder in the gym and my car (as long as I remove the rubber cup holder insert). I highly recommend buying this. I've never owned a yeti or hydro flask.. so I cannot compare, but this is a great option for anyone who doesnt want to spend an arm and a leg on an insulated water bottle."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I already own a 32 oz hydroflask with a straw lid which I love but I left it at my office and I have not been back since the panedmic.  I decided to buy another one for home to use during working out and also throughout the day.  I just did not wan to pay the $40+ I paid for the hydroflask so I looked for a similar bottle (with moderate expectations of equivalency).  This had good reviews so it was worth a short.  All in all, I really like it.  It comes in cute colors, a straw lid (and an extra regular lid), and was super easy to clean and use.  I also like the slim size since it fits in everything unlike my 32 oz hydroflask.  The lid sometimes catches and does not close tightly but I will just unscrew it and try again (obviously these types of issues do not happen with the hydroflask, but for half the price, it is not a big deal).  As for keeping water cold, I have not had a chance to let the water sit for a long time as I bought this to drink from it throughout the day and I finish it fairly quickly (within a few hours), but during that time, it does keep the water cold enough."

        "content": "I love these bottles! I have 3 of them and actually prefer them to the pricier flasks. Today, I filled 1/4 of it with ice and the rest with water at 7 am. The water is still ice cold now, at 6 pm. That’s how awesome these bottles are. I haven’t tried using anything hot in it because I have travel mugs that are better for that purpose.I removed one star because the straw lid leaks. Badly. I discovered this because I put some electrolytes in the bottle with water and shook it. Water sprayed everywhere with each shake. If I was reviewing just the lid, I’d give it 1 star."

        "content": "The flask keeps my beverages and water nice and cold for a long time. I like that it has a handle to carry it and the integrated straw is great. But the fact that it can’t go into the dishwasher is a big problem. The lid with the drinking spout is almost impossible to thoroughly clean and the plastic straw grows mold inside within a short amount of time even after being washed in hot, soapy water. What’s the use of this flask when I still have to pour drinks into a glass? It will go into the garbage bin."
