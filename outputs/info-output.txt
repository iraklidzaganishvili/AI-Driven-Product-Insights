        "title": "These are not sealed and that’s how it’s suppose to be",
        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "At first I was all upset that these weren’t sealed and I inspected them and they didn’t have any indication they were used. Had some dust and maybe a bit of residue on the outside of the bottle probably due to storage in the warehouse. Anyways, I was about to return them when I went to the store and checked to see if they should be sealed or not. This company (Avent) is weird. Some of their products like the glass bottles, nipples only and the set with the giraffe pacifier are sealed but the 3 or 4 pack, and individual plastic ARE NOT. Not only this company but as well as Dr. Brown and Nuk. The only ones that I saw was sealed with all their products were the brand Tommee Tippy or MAM. I guess since since you have to sterilize them in boiled water, they thought no need seal. Anyways, I would think anything that touches baby’s mouth should be sealed for sanitation reason. Anyways, I love Avent bottles, I used them on my first baby and they never gave her and hopefully my new baby colic. I did notice one of the green thing was cracked after sterilizing in boiled water, no biggie. These can be a bit tricky and do have some leakage but gotta just readjust baby sucking and no leaking."

However, I tried one of these bottles out from a free pack and instantly fell in love. My baby has less spit up, less leakage and doesn’t get the hiccups every time she eats! The major benefit is that they don’t have 7284 parts! Worth every penny!"
