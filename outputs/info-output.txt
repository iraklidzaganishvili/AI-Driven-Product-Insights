The kit comes with some nice sized rocks along with an identification chart & small magnifier for closeup viewing of his rocks. It also came with some geodes for him to crack open with a hammer. This little boy was totally thrilled!!!"

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "This is a great bundle! I am an adult and an avid rock collector and this was a great selection. The reason there are 300 pieces is there is a thick, full small bag of chips (picture in bag) and a good amount of smaller pebble stones (picture in selenite bowl). There is a small handful of tumbles and a small handful of fossils. I received a great variety! The chips and small pebbles were different stones than are advertised, but that can make it a fun challenge for people wanting to learn more. The book was also great with lots of fun information, it also has plenty of pictures so this set is great for kids, young adults, or adults!"
