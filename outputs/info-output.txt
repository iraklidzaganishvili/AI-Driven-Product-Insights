        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I got these to use with my Pocketbook for use at work. They work well and erase even better. I don't have any complaints. I feel like the price was right for how many pens and refills you get and they fit in my purple friction pen so I'm not always stuck with the black only ones. Really love theses pens. They feel amazing and are light. No fatigue in the hand. Perfect for most uses. Just be careful if you're going to be leaving them in a warm car or leaving what you wrote in inside the car. The ink will disappear if it gets too hot."

        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "My husband uses these all the time because he loves that they erase clearly when he wants to change something.  However, he was not aware that they erase because of heat.  He left some important notes in a locked up in the car in the South Carolina sunshine, and when he went to read them, the pages were blank!  Upon doing some research, I found that the ink disappears at 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Thankfully, I also found out that it reappears when it reaches 17 degrees Fahrenheit.  We put the pages in the deep freezer for a few hours and his notes came back.I am not crazy about these pens.  While they are a fine point, which I like, and they feel pretty good in the hand, I feel that the ink runs out too quickly.  I think that's an issue with most gel pens, but these seem to be more so than most, and he is always needing more. And that disappearing trick doesn't endear them to me!"

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "These are great pens if you need/like the ability to erase. I have been using them for years.Be careful with heat. If you leave them a hot car, the ink can stop flowing. Also efficient heat will erase whatyou write. Just try getting close to steam. So know what you write is not guaranteed to be permanent.Occasionally a pen will just stop writing even though it has ink. Not sure why.Still, for their erasing feature, they are worth it for me."

        "content": "The pens are great. Erases like a pencil. The only thing I caution about is the fine point.  With the black ink it always appears as of your ink is running out. Thicker point makes for a perfect pen."
