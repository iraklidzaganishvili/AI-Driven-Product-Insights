And thankfully it does not leak! But it doesn't fit in my cup holder in my car, so that's my only complaint. The handle that it comes with is not going to fit your wrist. So you can really only stick your fingers through the loop and hold it that way. Which is fine with me."

I wanted a bottle with a top that screws on like a plastic water bottle because in my experience, that is easier to close than when the top screws inside. For traveling, having a hand strap should make it easier to keep hold of it. I also did NOT want a straw. While a bottle with a straw is great for active situations, I don't like taking pills with a straw. I was impressed with the leak proof performance when I had partially closed it late at night and it slipped out of my hand and fell, but didn't leak. It is also insulated, keeping the water cold all night. The only challenge is that on my uninsulated metal water bottles, I can guess the fill level from my refrigerator spout by the location of the cooler part of the bottle. This one got overfilled the first time I used it because there is no temperature differential on the outside during filling."

I tote it around with me everywhere, and it's a great size for that (just barely fits in my purse and doesn't leak) and keeps my water cold for a while, which my old bottle didn't do. Despite my best efforts, I've already dropped it on gravel once in the few weeks since I got it, which chipped the paint and only barely dented the metal, so hopefully this is sturdier than my other bottle, too. I like the twist cap style as opposed to a straw or anything else because this style is easier to clean. My one gripe is that the cap can be difficult to twist off when it's slippery, because it has no ridges to grip."

        "content": "I really like the size and color designs. I’m so happy this fits in the car’s cup holder. I’ve been searching for an insulated water bottle that fits in the car’s cup holder without an extender and is dishwasher safe and has a twist cap for a long time and finally found the perfect fit with these bottles. These are such a great size and they’re really easy to grip and hold in one hand because the circumference is not wide like others.I don’t need all the caps and straws etc. but it’s nice to have options I guess. I only like to use the twist cap because I feel like that’s the only cap that can be cleaned well in the dishwasher. I don’t like the other options because I don’t feel like it would clean well in the dishwasher and I don’t want to hand wash them. It would be better if there was a cheaper option to choose just one type of cap.The cap has a nice rigid handle. I have another water bottle that has a soft rubber like handle that flops to the side all the time and gets in the way. This one doesn’t get in the way and stays in place. It’s very stiff and sometimes a little hard to move but still works well. It also doesn’t make my water taste like plastic when the condensation drips into the water bottle. My other brand cap does and it’s a little concerning that I could be drinking plastic. This one sometimes has a little tiny bit of plastic taste but nothing like my other cap. If manufacturers can somehow figure out a way to make the inside of the cap stainless steel too, then that would be perfect.The insulation works okay. I fill the water bottle approximately with 13 oz of hot water at 8:15 am and by 12 pm it’s warm. The 13 oz of water is made up of approximately 9 oz of boiling hot water and 4 oz of room temperature water, so the water is still pretty hot but it just doesn’t stay that temperature less than 4 hours later. A lot of these types of insulated water bottles don’t hold the same temperature for the stated amount of time they advertise and this one is no different. It still works because I don’t want it that hot by lunch time but it would be better if it worked the way it is stated.I also tried filling it with 13 oz of only boiling water to see if it works any better. The temperature is hotter than when I put the mixture. By lunch time it’s a drinkable hot temperature where you can only drink medium sips without burning your tongue or throat. After I filled it with straight hot boiling water, the mixture I did before is now hotter than before by lunch time; it’s now hot but drinkable instead of just warm. So by lunch time it’s the same as if I put all boiling water.Overall, so far I think this the best insulated bottle I have out of all the water bottles I have. It has a great wide opening so you can fill it easily and it fits all the other features I was looking for: fits in cup holder, insulated, and has a twist cap."

        "content": "This set of tumblers is great, I love that it comes with 3 separate tops although admittedly we only use the spout it is nice to know that we have options.  I have also used the flat top once when I took both bottles with me on a trip.  One to drink out of and the other to refill.One of the things I like best about this set of bottles is the carry handle.  I have several bottles that have the side handle but the thing about those bottles is that they are not always convenient to carry in an upright position and if you are using the straw swinging the bottle can cause some to leak out.The set comes with three changeable lids, a plain flat lid, a straw/spout lid that allows you to suck the contents and a sports spout that you just tilt the tumbler up and drink from it or let the liquid free flow out of the bottle if you are sharing it.  The bottles also come with two sets of straws, 4 in all and two brushes that can be used to clean the straws.  I think that initially when the fat straws started to get popular people forgot you needed a way to clean them.  So the brushes are a welcomed addition to the set.The ad says that the bottles are dishwasher safe however I prefer to wash them by hand.  The bottle has a wide mouth opening that helps when filling the bottle with ice.  In addition, I like that no matter how cold the contents of the bottle that the outside would not sweat especially since I often just drop the bottle inside my bag with my books, purse, papers, etc.The bottle can be used for both hot and cold beverages which again is something that you want in a tumbler.  Some of the prices can be extremely high and the versatility is a plus.  This set is very responsibly priced with both bottles costing less than one of the more popular brands.  This particular bottle comes in a variety of colors and several different volumes.  It would have been nice if you could have mixed different-sized bottles in one order.As far as keeping your drinks hot or cold they seem to do well during the course of the day and even retain some coolness in the AM but the ice is generally gone.  Since I use them mainly on the go I am okay with the performance.I give the bottles a 9 rating.  I think I would give a 10 if the bottles fit in the cup holders in the car.  I got the larger bottle and they do not.  All in all though, I would recommend them and buy them again.  I am thinking of buying one for the whole family and having them customized to take on summer vacation."

        "content": "I found the perfect size for my primary or secondary tumbler. I have a tumbler with me at all times, it has coffee in the winter and water in summer. Well sometimes it has a mixed drink as I'm relaxing on the patio. The tumbler I've been using for sometime now is only 20 oz. Don't get me wrong, it works great but is limited in functionality. This two pack of 27 oz tumblers is a great replacement or addition to it. Although I like the smaller size of my 20 oz tumbler, I find so often 20 oz is just not enough. With the BJPKPK I get 7 more ounces. For shorter trips that's enough but for longer trips I'll take my 20 oz and have this 27 oz as a refill unit. Or maybe take both 27 oz units. My reasoning is I still like my 20 oz tumbler because it fits in the cup holder, I don't have oversized cup holders. And I have 27 oz tumblers that are tapered on the bottom, but I feel they are too tall and not comfortable to use. So I like the design of these tumblers because the circumference is wide but still easy to grip and the height is similar to my 20 oz tumbler. The paint on the tumblers feels good and is not slippery when wet. I love the handles and now I have a choice of tops to use for my purpose. 1 top is solid (Flex) to store whatever I want and when needed I can either pour it out or take a drink. The 2nd top is a spout and my favorite to drink from. The spout has a hinged screw cover that takes only a couple of twist to open. The larger hole works great for everything to include iced drinks. Lastly the 3rd lid is the straw lid. It has a mouth spout that flips up when needed and a straw below. The flip motion is smooth and does not leak when closed. In fact none of the lids leaked. Every lid screws on securely and has a handy handle. I've tested with coffee and hours later my coffee was still hot. I've also left ice in the tumbler for over 24 hours and there was still some ice left. I had to do the ice test to compare to my expensive tumbler and I'm pleased these tumblers worked just as well. I really don't see myself using the straw lid, I'm not a straw using guy but the other 2 lids will get tons of use. For those who like the straws, this kit does come with 4 straws and 2 cleaning brushes. These tumblers are a very important addition to my collection and will replace a couple of my older tumblers permanently. I've spent more on 1 tumbler that does half of what these do. Great price for some very nice tumblers."

        "content": "These bottles are very well made and strong.  The colors match what I see on my screen. On the bottom of the bottles it says dishwasher safe. I put them in the dishwasher before using them for the first time and both of them came out with lighter colored marks shaped like water drops and the bottoms were very faded. These marks and faded spots are permanent and do not wash off.  These need to be hand washed if you want to keep the color nice.  I tested one by filling it with hot water.  The water was measured with a digital meat thermometer.  It started out at 176 degrees and after about 12 hours it was 104 degrees.  The bottle was opened several times during the 12 hours to check the temperature so I expect that the final temperature would have been a bit higher if the bottle was not opened until the 12 hours were over.It came with 6 lids 4 straws and 2 cleaning brushes.  I did not want to mess with having to clean the straws so I chose the lid with no spout and my husband chose one of the lids that has a spout, but works with no straw."

These work very well for that purpose, but not perfectly.  I like pretty much everything about them and will use them often; but they do not live up to the promise of keeping liquids hot or cold for the promised amount of time.  Aside from that, love them; and they do hold the temperature fairly well, at least long enough to last through most of a commute and work day.Something you don't see with every other water bottle is that everything you need to really make use of these is included.  In addition to the two water bottles, there are 3 types of lids for different purposes, reusable straws (2 per bottle), and brushes to clean each straw (have you ever tried to clean a straw without a straw brush?).  Lids are made from heavy material and should last a very long time; they screw on and off easily and make a tight seal even without using much pressure.  The solid lid with a carry handle is very convenient, the one with a straw hole folds down flush to keep liquids from leaking when not being used, and the third with a pour spout has an easy to remove cap for the spout.I got the 22 ounce size which is easy to grip and carry partially because of the size and also because of the powdery outside coating which just feels nice and is non-slip.The liquid temp, as already mentioned, did not hold as long as expected; but was still OK.  In a heated liquid test (see video) I started with 160 F. water poured into a bottle that had been pre-rinsed with the same temp water.  With the solid lid in place, I waited 4 hours and checked the temp which had fallen to 133.  After 18 hours, the temp was at 99 degrees .. still warm but not hot.  I did not test the cold retention but expect similar results.These are very nice liquid bottles at a fair price considering all the added items.  And compared to other similar products, they are a clear winner."

        "content": "Since I am very concerned that I stay hydrated, I have for at least 20 years been buying and accumulating water bottles to carry with me to work, use in the car on trips and have around the house, next to my computer and bedside. They all are either 750 ML or one L transparent plastic and start off with a bite valve or similar straw because I like to not have to elevate the liquid; prefer sucking through a straw. And since I use just water and not coffee or tea or any other hot or cold beverage I just rinse them out and refill with water. The water out of my tap is usually room temperature or colder after running a few seconds.The problem has been that due to aging the silicone bite valve becomes loose and leaks air or loses its water seal and begins to leak if I tip it over or just gets lost since it is just held on by friction. And the flexible plastic carrying handle on top breaks so I end up having to replace a lot of parts and make new handles out of webbing and a worm clamp; not a professional look. Furthermore if I wanted to use the water vessel to carry soup or stew I don't have a suitable closure for the top. And the stainless steel vacuum insulated tumblers I have, some from Amazon, are tapered and therefore must be tall to accommodate the 750 ML to 1 L of water I want to carry with me and they don't have a handle and if they have a screw on or press on cap the straw does not seal 100 percent so tends to leak if tipped. And I can wash the bottom in the dishwasher but not the top.Now this tumbler solves all these problems and is dishwasher safe. Each of the two tumblers in this kit came with three different screw on leakproof caps, each with a handle, two straws and a straw cleaning brush. So you get two bottoms, six tops, four straws and two straw cleaning brushes. The inside diameter of the top, 2 inches (5 cm), is the same as my other tumblers. Of the three tops for each tumbler, one is solid and seals perfectly so you could carry soup or stew, the second has a 7/8 inch (22 mm) outside diameter chug type mouthpiece 3/4 inch (19 mm) high to drink out of if you want to invert the tumbler. This mouthpiece, which is smooth on the outside (is threaded on the inside), is tightly sealed by a captive screw cap attached with a hinge; very nice design. The third, Which is the one I use, has a built-in hinged straw mouthpiece with air compensation valve that lowers and seals perfectly with no leaking at all when inverted and shaken. The colors are fully acceptable in professional gatherings.This tumbler fits perfectly in my car's large cupholder, having a uniform cylindrical shape (no taper) with the same 3.5 inch (9 cm) outside diameter as my other 1 L water bottles. And holds 32 ounces (950 ML). The screw caps, besides having strong nonflexible hinged handles also has a nicely textured, easily gripped surface.In conclusion: my new go-to water bottle. Very highly recommend."

I love that I have different lids to choose from. My only real complaint is for the pop/screw top lid. It needs to be tightened extremely well or it will leak.

If you have smaller hands like my wife you may not like it since she can't drink from it one handed. Part of the reason I purchased this particular bottle was because of the included extra lids, I was hoping they'd fit an Amazon Basics bottle whose lid broke, sadly they do not. I use the flip top lid and compared to the basics lid it's great since it's one handed operation to open and close. The other lids are just taking up space in storage but at least if this one breaks I'll have backups instead of having to buy a whole nother bottle. I've dropped it a few times and the finish seems to have held up great, though upon closer inspection there is a small scratch that I only noticed because I was looking for it. On a solid color it may be more obvious. Wide mouth makes it easy to fill and clean."

        "content": "I purchased the black 64oz bottle and have been using this bottle daily for about two months now. It has great and has met all my expectations. I’m currently living in a tropical climate which means it’s hot and humid all the time. So I needed a large bottle to keep my beverages cold and so I could stay hydrated throughout the day. Since I’ve gotten this bottle I’ve been drinking over a gallon a day.I love that this bottle does not sweat, leaving rings or pools of water behind like non-insulated bottles do. The coating on the bottle looks nice and adds grip which makes holding it easy even when full. This bottle comes with lots of accessories for using and clean adding to the quality and value of this product vs the last one I owned from a different brand.Lids:I love that it comes with multiple caps/lids that are easy to swap out depending on the use. I use the flip straw lid while at school where the bottle sits on my desk and im taking frequent sips. When I’m at home I set it down a lot and so I’m drinking from it less frequently but at greater volume so that’s where the spout lid comes in handy.The paracord handle: It’s a great addition that my previous bottle from a different brand didn’t have and makes carrying it very easy and convenient. Additionally, im apprehensive about carrying the bottle by the lid all the time while it’s full because i can only imagine the nightmare it would be if the lid popped off and the bottle hit the ground causing denting it and then having to deal with half a gallon of fluids all over the floor. Now with that being said I have on occasion held the bottle by the lid and I’ve had no issues.Thermo regulation(hot/cold): I’ve never used it with any hot fluids so unfortunately I can’t share any insight on that. As far as keeping beverages cold I have a little insight. Based on how much I’m drinking I’m refilling this bottle more than once a day. So with that being said testing the limits of how long it keeps beverages cold isn’t something I’m doing. The longest I’ve kept fluid in the bottle is about 12 hours. I filled it up a bit before bed and in the morning it seemed just as cold as when it went in.Potential improvements: Due to the structure, size, and weight when it makes contact with another surface it can be a bit clunky or noisy. This can be resolved with foam/fabric cover or another option I’ve seen is a silicone cap that goes over the bottom of the bottle. Both these options aid in shock absorption and reduces any noise. I know people who have each of these on their bottles and they love them.TLDR: This bottle has lots of great features, it’s a good value and has met or exceeded all my expectations. Based on my experience I’d recommend it to family and friends."

The many lid options are also very convenient.  It’s very sturdy and scratch resistant.  I have dropped it a couple times and it’s just fine.  But, it’s a very tall bottle. As you can see in the pic, it’s a little taller than a paper towel roll.  The wide base makes it difficult to put in the sides of bags or cup holders in cars.  It’s also very heavy.  When empty, it’s about 1.12lbs and over 3.5lbs when filled. It’s hard to carry around in the gym or to the park.  For now, I use it when I am working at my desk."

If you wanted to buy these things separate, you'd spend more than you did on the bottle. So it's cool you can get them included with a metal insulated jug like this. Very convenient for campouts.No leaks with the straw lid and Spout Lid. Both are more sturdy than my previous ones (stays closed, won't over tighten and skip a thread). And the 64oz lids fit my wide mouth 32oz hydroflasks perfectly.Cheaper to buy a new bottle with 3 lids+accessories instead of just buying a replacement lid set. 10/10 recommend.Keeps that drink COLD. I use this 64oz as a water Buffalo for my easier to carry 32oz. Refill with the pour Spout Lid and enjoy the cold bev. My hydroflask has dents and can't keep anything cold.

If I had known it wasn’t going to be heavy, Wish I’d bought the 64oz instead. Gave it a 10.

I wasn’t sure about it at first, but it turned out to be my 13 year old son’s favorite water bottle! I tried it to see if it actually worked and I liked it a lot too! There is only a straw attached inside so it is easy to clean. It locks tight and is leak proof, which tested often when he throws his backpack into the floor. He leaves ice in it at night and there is still ice in it the next morning, so it keeps drinks cold for quite awhile. It fits in the cup holders of the car. I highly recommend this water bottle!"

        "content": "I saw the good reviews and gave this a try, and I LOVE it!  Not only is it beautiful, with its gorgeous interplay of vivid colors, but it WORKS.  To be honest, I wasn't sure how it could have an \"attached straw,\" but as soon as I tried to take a sip, I realized that it works.  It works beautifully.  The color combination I wanted came in a smaller form, so I usually have to refill it halfway through the day, but this water bottle makes taking a sip so easy and so carefree - the best quality (to me) is that when it's closed, this doesn't leak AT ALL.  With the lock mechanism so easy to use, the pop-up top is easy to open and close, and that makes this my most carefree water bottle.  I've started bringing it with me everywhere.  (Oh, and it fits into my car's cup holder, which I cannot say for the \"Stanley Cup\" knockoff.)  Such a great bottle - I'm probably going to buy a few more.  Try one for yourself and see if you don't agree!  Easy to hold, easy to carry, easy to use, and pretty!"

It is actually the perfect size for me although it says for kids. It fits in my work bag or backpack quite nicely. It has a straw option or an opening where you can just drink out of. I just drink out of it because I prefer it and because it has a comfortable sipping design. (Feels good, easy to clean). I haven’t had any leakage issues even though I do toss them in my bag quite haphazardly. And the part that I like the most is although it appears to not hold ice cubes for very long,  the water stays nice and cold for quite a long time. I have brought it home at night, forgotten it in my bag and the next morning the water is still cold. I have other more expensive bottles that once the cubes are gone, the water warms up very quickly. Not so with this bottle. I don’t know how that happens but I am very glad that it does."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I love that the bottle has a large capacity (40 oz) but still fits well in backpack bottle holders (if it can hold a 32 oz Nalgene, it can hold the 40 oz Owala). The sipping straw feature built into the mouthpiece is surprisingly comfortable and very easy and convenient to use regardless if you're sipping or swigging. The design of the mouthpiece also makes it very easy to clean compared to other sipping bottles like a bite valve bottle. The stainless steel vacuum interior holds water temperature very well and is very easy to clean, especially with the wide mouth opening when the cap is removed. The cap secures very well and you can feel the tight seal when you close it, giving you confidence that it won't leak. The silicone seal for the mouthpiece also can be removed very easily for cleaning and the carrying handle folds in very well and locks in securely. Everything locks into place with a very satisfying, secure click.The one caveat, or limitation, of the bottle is that the seal on the mouth piece is so effective that it can cause the straw to store water when you remove the cap when the bottle is full. This may lead to some spillage from the end of the straw if the mouthpiece seal is opened after the removal of the straw. Also, when filling the bottle, be sure to replace the cap with the mouthpiece seal open or some water may shoot out of the mouthpiece when you open the seal as the water rushes into the straw when the air is released. In my opinion, this is a very minor issue.Overall, the bottle has quickly become my everyday water bottle. It fits into my bag's bottle pockets very well and is great for leaving on my desk at work to sip water from while also being great to take swigs from while at the gym, or when I'm especially thirsty. The simple design makes it easy to clean and the stainless steel interior holds temperature very well while being plastic free."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "When I was pregnant with my second daughter I was surprised when my doctor advised me to not drink from plastic or cook with non-stick.  I did some research and we made changes, including converting to stainless steel water bottles.  It has been so hard to find a good water bottle that is all stainless steel and doesn’t leak.  Klean Kanteen is decent, but the silicone inserts that seal the lid break down over time and literally shred apart.  If I’m paying a premium price, I don’t want a water bottle with a short lifespan.  ThermoFlask is another decent option, but we’ve had the same issue with the lid seal breaking down, and also the straws seem to wear out.  They get sort of scuffed up and discolored, and by the end of the day the water starts to have a funny plastic taste.  Makes me wonder what the heck I’m marinating in my water all day.  So we decided to give Owala a try, and for us, these are the best option we’ve found so far.  The bottle itself is insulated stainless steel, and only the lid and straw are plastic.  But they seem to be “better” plastic = super hard and durable plastic, including the straw which is rigid and does not bend (ThermoFlask plastic straws bend).  Maybe this type of plastic is more resistant to wear and tear, I’m not sure, all I know is that we can leave water in the bottles for DAYS and it still tastes just like water, no funky flavors.  I can stick all parts in the dishwasher over and over again, including the straw, and they come out clean and looking brand new every time, without stains.  The silicone insert that seals the lid seems to be better designed and more resistant to breaking down than Klean Kanteen and Thermoflask.  My girls love all the different fun color options, it’s nice to be able to chug if you are super thirsty, or keep the bottle upright to take a sip from the straw.  Especially for our youngest, the straw feature is essential.  And the bottles can take a beating, we’ve dropped them on sidewalks, hardwood floors, concrete, etc and they are still going strong.  A note on sizing, the 24 oz and 32 oz sizes are actually the exact same height, it’s just the 24oz is a little thinner.  I’ve included side-by-side photos.  There really is not much physical difference between these two capacities, so we bumped up to the 32 oz for my daughter who is in first grade, since she was running out of water by the end of the school day with the 24 oz.  The 32 oz still easily fits in the side pocket of her backpack, and it’s enough water for her to get through the day.  Bottom line - these water bottles are durable, they function great, and they keep our water cold and fresh and free of funky flavors.  Until someone cracks the code for a durable, 100% all stainless-steel water bottle with a straw that doesn’t leak, these are the go-to in our household.  Highly recommend."

My sister had just gotten this water bottle gifted to her and absolutely loved it and recommended it to me. I did a ton of research and concluded this one would be the best run for my money. I love the anti-wrinkle straw and just being able to sip from my water bottle but also being able to chug from it if i'm thirsty out of my mind. Even though I don't really drink cold water, it keeps water cold for a very long time. I love that I can just throw it in my backpack and put that handle/lock (which I also love for the multipurpose of the handle) on it so nothing hits it and it doesn't accidentally pop open. I got the denim color and for some reason I was surprised of the colors and I don't love the colors on my water bottle but its still cute. The water bottle is also very easy to clean but I find that I have to clean it almost every weak because it gets buildup of stuff on the sip holes especially when I have stuff on my lips like vaseline. But overall super great water bottle and it is in fact my new emotional support water bottle!"

        "content": "To be fair, my baby will accept practically any bottle with some kind of nipple attached to it. We are spoiled for choice thanks to his tolerance for slow flow, fast flow, natural nipples, glass sides, BPA-free plastic or magic composites. However, the Comotomos are both the parental and the infant favourites in our household thanks to their innovative design, very broad nipple, and outstanding materials.We ordered two of these to test how they worked, and ordered three more a few weeks later. These bottles feel durable and strong, right out of the package. Their soft silicone sides are completely forgiving to being dropped -- they bounce! Since baby is almost 6 months old, he's starting to hold bottles himself and he can get a much better grip on the non-slippery surface than his glass or plastic bottles. The materials don't fog up in the dishwasher either, and disassembling the parts to stick them in is a snap. The Comotomo bottle has only four pieces: bottle, nipple, plastic ring, lid. No fussing with inserts, bags, anticolic devices or the rest, and all the pieces are generously sized so a bottle brush fits right in. The neck ring is secure and gets a firm grip.The baby loves the clear nipple. Its wide, domed design approximates the natural shape of Mom, so he had no trouble whatsoever going between nursing and bottle-feeding. We alternate because I work and he attends daycare, and he took to the Comotomos like a fish to water. The nipple rarely collapses or deforms due to his strong suck, a persistent problem with Evenflo and Medela brands. If it does, however, the perfectly designed thumb tab on the neck ring just needs a little nudge and air flows right back into the bottle. Presto, fixed. Baby gets few problems with sucking down excess air, which he suffered with our other bottles in greater proportion. We will be buying the upgraded flow nipples when he's ready for them.These bottles go down well with everyone. His caretakers at infant-care love them for easy cleanup and the even heating in their bottle warmer. His grandparents find them easy to hold on to, even with some mobility issues (arthritis). They look great after two months of daily use and washing, not one scratch or nick, no cloudy appearance, no heavy wear. Friends can easily gauge how much he's eaten when they watch the baby, and no one is left struggling in the middle of the night trying to pull the lid off a slippery bottle. Seriously, the lid and body snap together like nothing, and even soaking wet (and sealed by my stronger husband), I can get the neck ring off one-handed. What more could you want?If I had to change two things about these bottles, and these are minor quibbles, they would be to make the measure/gauge on the side more visible so I can tell where the topoff line is in low-light conditions (3AM bottle, anyone?); and to offer a blue colour to go along with neutral green and feminine pink."

        "content": "It's hard to believe that a baby bottle is capable of saving one's sanity.  I exclusively breastfed my son for 5 months after deciding that using a bottle for those times when it's just not possible to nurse a baby.  My son is my 6th (and final) child, so I've had a good deal of experience with baby bottles in the last 15 years.  I have spent hundreds of dollars over years on dozens of different styles and brands of baby bottles and none of them were without flaws, annoying quirks, time consuming or irritating downfalls, and/or many pieces to assemble. Comotomo has ended the search that plagues so many parents when trying to find the \"perfect\" bottle.The following are reasons why Comotomo Baby Bottles are my #1 pick, both as a mom (with a lot of kids) and as a Nurse and what sets these bottles apart from all of the others on the market today:-Uncomplicated.  A liquid storage base, nipple, ring to connect nipple to the base, and a cover.-Air flow valves built into the nipple that, unlike other brands, DO NOT LEAK and really do work!-No spilling or leaking- from anywhere.-Microwavable.-Easy to clean-The base is very soft.-Easy transition for baby from breast to bottle feeding or when alternating between the two.-Dramatically reduces nipple confusion.-The company makes connector rings for older babies that have handles for self feeding (I bought them)-Cool looking design- not too big, not too small.-Well built, do not show any signs of wear after months of use.I honestly cannot think of anything I don't like about these bottles. I'm so glad I stumbled across them and ordered them.  They were great when I ordered them and continue to work just as good now, several months later. They aren't as inexpensive as other bottles, but the Comotomo Bottles are without a doubt worth every penny- and then some! Highly recommended by this mommy!"

        "content": "I don’t know where to start. 5 kids over a 19 year span, many different kinds of bottles and these are my favorite. My daughter was a early and I breastfeed. Because my milk didn’t come in right away, I had to supplement some with formula. I started out with a different bottle (Nanobebe) and they worked ok. I had a problem with the way she latched on. She just couldn’t get it right and the other bottles made it worse. I received one of these bottles in a sample pack and somehow ended up using it one day. The flow is perfect. Most bottles even with a size 1 nipple will leak when turned upside down and the baby can drink really fast causing a bellyache from overeating. These bottles actually corrected her latching for breastfeeding and she had to suck harder on the bottle than the breast so she didn’t cry when she went back on the breast. No nipple confusion experience and she does not reject the breast for an easier to eat bottle. The body of the bottle is also soft but sturdy. This is the first bottle I’ve had that as a newborn the baby actually wanted to hold onto the bottle because it felt like mommy. It’s super easy to clean. I take it apart and throw it in the dishwasher and it comes out spotless whether I use formula or breast milk. I’ve read other reviews about having a film from the milk and I just wonder how long they left the milk in because I’ve never had that happen and I’ve had them in the fridge for two days with breast milk and been unable to wash after use until we got home hours later. They will leak if you don’t put the cap on and the bottle lands upside down with the nipple bent (fell over in the car seat). That is the only time I’ve seen it leak. It also has a little spot that sticks out on the ring that helps you twist the nipple on and off. This is useful to me because I have struggled with wet hands to open many of the others. The only downfall I see is that they weren’t made when I had my other kids."

        "content": "First off, this is hands-down my favorite purchase for my formula-fed son! 10/10! He was a VERY gassy baby before the bottle purchase, who was also already on sensitive formula prior to treat his gas.Here are a few of the most common complaints I read about the bottles prior to our purchase:Tip over easily/ top heavy; egg shape is poor design; hard to open and close; leaking; air valves sticking shut; difficult to read measurements... despite these complaints we decided to try them and here is our thoughts!!The reviews stating that the egg-shaped design is simply for aesthetic appeal and not practical are simply missing the big picture! The tapered design is necessary for accurate ounce measurements while accounting for the shape of the large nippletop! Sure a cylinder shaped bottle may not weeble wobble but if you don't mind taking an extra 0.3 seconds to set the bottle down up right you will have no problems at all!The soft squishy bottle reviewers are stating is very difficult to open and close, I myself have had no problems... I simply cup my hand around the solid rim of the top of the silicone bottle while opening and closing.That's squishy design is very clever in my opinion! It is designed to replicate a mother's breast along with the large, wide nipple top. This makes for a much easier transition for a breastfed baby to a bottle because the silicone is squishy and feels like a mother's full breast well the nipple is wider and larger like a real breast and they don't have to change their latching technique. My son was never breastfed and he has had no problems transitioning from a normal typical bottle top to the larger wider nipple... If anything, it has helped enormously because he naturally and instinctually opens wider for a breast, and when he nursed a normal bottle you would hear suckling sounds from the corners of his mouth while latching... Which ultimately was just additional air intake for my already gassy baby!!The valves on the nipple are what caught my attention the most. They're designed to let air in the bottle so that there is a consistent flow of milk without the disruption of collapsing a bottle we're pulling the bottle away to relieve the suction. For us, the valves worked as advertised! We have had no issues with the valves being stuck closed with clumps of milk or sticking together.. perhaps this is because we are using formula? Or maybe thoroughly cleaning or bottles and valves? I am unsure because we have had no issues whatsoever!!!Also, we have had no issues whatsoever with leaking. There was one user error where I did not insert the nipple in the collar straight which resulted in minor leaking but I open the bottle, closed it again, and everything was fine. We have had no leaks from the valves... Maybe this is caused by people inserting a cleaning brush into them and they are becoming misshapened?? Perhaps just a faulty nipple??The other biggest complaint I read which concerning the ounce measurements on the side of the bottle. Some reviewers stated they were difficult to read and or did not like the fact that there was only measurements on one side of the bottle. All of the other bottles I have used, including common types like Medela, have all had only one measurement bar on the entire bottle. To me this is not a huge deal because you just turn the bottle and it's right there!! I can understand how measurements could be difficult to see, since the bottle of silicone and not plastic, the measurements are molded into the side of the silicone bottle rather than printed measurements like the Medela bottles. this is also not been a big deal to me because let's remember mommies and daddies out there, this bottle is designed to help our babies eat better, more comfortably, without gas and colic! So ultimately I do not mind looking at the bottle, placing my thumb near the ounce mark I'm wanting to use ( which I also made a habit of doing on my bottles that were plastic and printed) in order to use it as a filling guide for milk or water levels..hopefully this helps some of you out there debating whether or not to make the investment. The price is significantly more expensive then a typical bottle but for our situation it was worth every penny because our baby is so much more comfortable and we were able to see a difference in our sons gassiness immediately!!!My opinion: take the plunge and invest! I will do my best to make time and record/ upload a video review!"

        "content": "We loved these bottles, bought the 5 oz with slow flow nipples first then purchased the 8 oz with medium flow nipple when our daughter was 4 months old. We tried a bunch of different bottles and these were the only bottles that we purchased in the 8 oz size.These were great for paced feeding since the milk comes out when baby suckles but not when baby is not actively feeding, so it doesn’t spill everywhere. We hold the bottle horizontal so the nipple is only half full of milk so not too much comes out at once. I agree with some reviewers that the slow flow nipple on these is faster than some other bottles we tried but since we were using paced feeding it worked for us. (To be honest the bottles we tried that were slower (Phillips avent) just frustrated our daughter and made feeding time a nightmare.)They are easy to clean! Some bottles have multiple parts (dr browns) that make cleaning time consuming. (You can remove the vent on dr browns but we found that caused so many air bubbles that we spent more time burping, and it also wastes milk.) These bottles don’t cause air bubbles if you have the vent up where there is no milk ( if you’re doing paced feeding) while also not have extra pieces.They have a great shape that make feeding easy, which is what is most important. Easy for travel, we have a small cooler bag that fits 2 bottles. They are not expensive! I would be willing to pay more for how quality these bottles are. They work great for both breast milk and formula, we pre mix our formula with the dr browns mixer.Overall we love these bottles and are very happy with this purchase!"

        "title": "Dr Brown’s awesome! Skinny on several types of bottles, on leaks, and too many parts to clean!!",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "Dr Brown’s bottles, in general, are great!! Each one, however, is slightly different and overall I prefer the Options, even though my baby is not old enough to use valve-less.  I have the original (terrible at spills, because the white cap in the shape of a top hat, sort of, doesn’t stop any liquid at all; they have clear bottles, blue tubies, and whitish valves).  I have 4oz blue Options (great, easy parts, thumb print on the lid is awesome for popping that sucker off, and the lid also has these bumps that line up with the nipple, where it slows down the leaking of liquids, and keeps the leak in the cap, although given the ease of taking the cap off, it can still get really messy). (Sorry for the run on sentences, I’m a sleep deprived mama!!) I have the 4oz pink Options (similar to the blue, but actually the valve fits very snuggly along with the tubey part into the bottle, so that can be handy when trying to put the bottle together or add formula, while also holding a baby - more stable than any of the other bottles, where the tubey/valve pieces are just loose kind of sitting on top of the bottle; similar cap as the blue, but no thumb print, and harder to get the cap off, especially one handed). Lastly, I have the 8oz Options with plain bottles and with the Dream/Adventure and Animal characters, all with the green valves and tubies, and the similar cap to the blue, except they are clear, thumbprint included!  These have been great, and the animal characters are super cute; the ‘dream big’ and ‘adventure awaits’ are cute-meh. The only thing I was disappointed in that set, is that half the bottles had characters, and half were plain. I may be off on the count, because I bought two sets, but I remember being bummed that I paid a premium for cuteness, and didn’t get a full set of cuteness! I do not own, but have used some purple wide bottles that I was loaned while traveling. That was great, so I wouldn’t have to carry a bunch of bottles, but I wouldn’t/didn’t buy them; they’re just too wide for my taste, harder to handle, especially one handed, and I didn’t feel the wide nipple was significantly better for my baby girl. I will address two of the main two complaints I’ve seen about Dr. Brown’s:  leaking and too many parts to clean!  Leaking, yes, totally a thing, but it does in fact say on the bottle to only fill to X line to avoid leaking! Having said that, it is very hard for my brain to perfectly calculate how much water I need for the formula, where I don’t end up exceeding the volume specified on ghe bottle! I personally don’t think it’s a huge issue. I know it’s going to or probably will, leak, given the liquid in the bottle, and what I do is to keep a cloth or bib under the bottle when she first starts drinking, and after the liquid is down a bit, I just open the bottle up and pull the valve/tubey piece up a bit, and several big drops come flying down the side of the bottle, which I just wipe off with the same bib/cloth. I can immediately get the bottle put back together before my daughter complains too terribly much. Remember, this is only an issue when you’re filling the entire bottle, either 4oz or 8, so at that point the baby is a bit older and can hopefully handle the briefest of pauses without too much of an issue. If my daughter were the type to go full on nuclear melt down, I think I would probably have to be more diligent about staying under the line, and offering more milk, once the bottle’s finished, and a fuller belly is less likely to melt down. Ok, regarding too many parts to clean... there’s what? Two extra parts that other bottles don’t have? Meh. But I will totally recommend getting the Dr Brown’s dishwasher baskets!!! Oh. Dude. Awesome sauce, life-saving, yes. I am very green, sustainable oreinted, so I cringe at how much water I’m consuming running the dishwasher sometimes every day. So not cool. And, I’m also a sole parent, so I gots a lot to take care of, dishwashy basket is a must!! I have 4.  : 0 ) I’m not a super fan of washing the nipples in the dishwasher, so I still do those by hand, no biggy. There’s even special baskets for just nipples; someone gave them to me, but no, I no likey since it looks like there’s still a film on the inside.My experience with Dr Brown’s bottles in general, has been awesome! I don’t even remember when I sorta stopped burping my baby (she’s six months now), it just happened organically over time, but when I was burping her (maybe for three months?), she would only have one, maybe two burps. She burps on her own now, but then maybe that’s just her, the point is that there was very little gas!  She had a wee bit of reflux as a newborn, but that’s normal I think, what with having an immature gut as a tadpole-baby. I gave her probiotics and kept her upright-ish, and I think the bottles helped. Ultimately, I totally recommend them!!  They were recommended to me by my sister, 8 years ago, as my nephew’s salvation, hope they work for you!"

We also learned the hard way as first time parents that the white flat caps are to be placed between the filter (green) and the cap/nipple to prevent leaking while traveling. Do not throw the white caps away they are to be used to prevent leaking bottles!All in all this is a great set of bottles by a great brand. We recommend this bottle set to first time parents.

Since week 1 we had been using another bottle brand with the slow flow nipple not knowing that this Dr. Brown’s bottle had an even slower flow that would be more suitable for him.  It has helped to prevent him over feeding at mealtime since it takes longer for him to draw out the milk.  I really wish I had know that about this bottle from the beginning.  But other product reviews I read on parenting websites focused on these bottles leaning on babies—which was a deterrent to choosing them. My experience regarding the leaking has not been pleasant.  I haven’t figured out how it happens 100% yet but I do know that during transportation if there is any jostling or if the bottle is carried in any position other than upright the nipple will drip into the lid of the bottle and then will leak into your bag, purse, stroller, etc.  I unknowingly lost about half an oz of water on the way to the auto shop which was super annoying because I had pre-measured the formula and had planned to feed while waiting.Since the slow flow benefit far outweighs my annoyance regarding the leaking, I would just recommend only transporting in a bag that will remain constantly upright to prevent leaks.The bottle design is simple, and it’s easier to clean than one would think with the removable vent parts.  If not for the leaking I’d have given five stars."

I got quite a few of these Dr Browns bottles in a variety of baby sample boxes so we decided to give it a try and my little one immediately took to the these bottles (narrow flow 1 nipples come with these bottles). It does appear to help with her burps and gassiness compared to the MAM bottled we used previously and there was no confusion for her making the switch from a wide base nipple to a more narrow base nipple.

The bottle nipple being shaped like that of a natural nipple makes it so much easier for her to keep a good seal while eating and we have noticed a considerable change in her fussiness after feedings and less gas buildup. There are a lot of parts to clean but it is absolutely worth it in my opinion and it comes with a little white disk you can place in the lid for bottles on the go to keep them from leaking!"

This is THE ONE. I should have got this sooner/first.I can't imagine a better bottle than this in terms of replicating a real nipple (I easily notice the higher quality in the material), ease of cleaning, and how attractive the bottle looks (the blue is so beautiful!!) -- and of course, a highly reputable well established brand.I was worried at first about the different nipple sizes. The default one that comes with this is \"Flow 3\" which is the middle level, targeted for 1 month old.My baby gobbles up milk like a starving child every time; this nipple works fine for him.He can finish the 4 oz milk less than 10 minutes, which is good. If it takes longer than 30 minutes to feed your baby, that's not right, and exhausting for the parent too.It doesn't make weird sounds when he's drinking and and it doesn't drip. There's no milk wasted either. So much better than the lame Dr. brand I was using before; that one also had so many parts to clean, it was more work.The top cap has a thumb grip area, which can still be a little difficult to open if it's wet. I also notice the silicone has a bit of certain odor when you get it.Philips AVENT is easily one of the best baby bottles on the market. It's the perfect gift - must have for any parents out there.It's life changing. It will make feeding time more convenient and a pleasure for you. It's worth spending extra considering you're going to be feeding your baby so many times. It was definitely worth the investment."

The mam, dr browns, chicco duo, parents choice wide neck, pigeon, avent anti colic, and my baby did not take well to them. For about 3-4 months we used the chicco duo and those were a favorite until I found these. They are easy to clean and the valve on the nipple for air works so amazing. My baby has very little air going into his tummy and he drinks the bottle without collapsing the nipple. He is 5 months but he loves to chug down so the sizing for these nipples is amazing. Size 3 is perfect for him since he can control it and I noticed he does not take as many breaks drinking, he just keeps drinking and maybe takes 2-3 breaks and then he keeps going usually he would collapse the chicco duo nipple even if I moved him to size 2 nipple. But I found these my savings grace and I am so happy. They are affordable in my opinion compared to other bottles that claim to do the same thing these do and they don’t. Anyway love these."

They are so nice because they are wide which makes it so much easier to fill. We use breast milk and supplement with formula so pouring from bags as well as putting in scoops of powdered formula is so much easier and you don't waste it by spilling it trying to get it into a standard size bottle neck. Another giant advantage for me is being able to actually read the numbers to measure.  The light blue is a nice faint shade, they are easy to hold and see how much milk is actually in the nipple so they don't get a bunch of air, which helps on too much gas. The nipples it comes with have a good shape that is more natural and soft against his face. He actually likes these best. They are also easier to clean and sturdy enough to last for years through multiple babies and the nipples can be replaced very easy as needed. They are a really good quality which makes the price worth it. I'm very happy with them I highly recommend these and I hope this info helps you."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "We were using the Dr. Browns bottles before this. Those bottles are good; however, these are our preferred bottles now for a few reasons:1) The nipples on this seem to mimic the shape of a breast more realistically than the Dr. Brown's or other bottles. For babies who sometimes refuse to take a bottle and only want to be breastfeed exclusively, this makes for an easy transition.2) These DO NOT leak, which is amazing when you're leaving the house and need to throw a bottle in the diaper bag. I've forgotten to put a lid on this in a hurry and was pleasantly surprised to find that even without a lid, traveling in a car, no milk leaked out!3) These bottles can hold up to 9oz! And not that I need 9 oz bottles right now with an infant, but it's nice that these bottles can work for all stages of my baby's growing needs, rather than having to replace bottles along the way.ALSO, and this, as a breastfeeding mother (who also pumps regularly) this is one of my FAVORITE things about this bottle... It's comparable with my Spectra pump parts!!! I didn't know this when I bought these bottles. It doesn't mention they fit on a spectra flange anywhere (at least to my knowledge) but one night when I was half asleep, I screwed the spectra flange onto the bottom of this Phillips bottle and low and behold! IT FIT!!! This was life changing! No more having to pump in one of those tiny spectra bottles and then transfer into another bottle for feedings. (Because let's be honest, who is feeding their baby with a spectra bottle directly? Those nipples are awful and cause so much gas for little tummies!) Now I can attach the flange directly to these bottles, pump, remove the flange, and cover with a nipple / lid! It saves so many unnecessary steps, plus, for women with an oversupply of breastmilk, it's amazing having a larger bottle for pumping (rather than those tiny 4 oz Spectra bottles) I can pump both breasts individually into one bottle and get a solid 8oz and know the bottle won't overflow!For any new moms out there wondering which bottles to buy, and the best way of pumping / storing, THESE bottles are your answer!! I highly recommend!"

They are seriously no fuss and work as they are intended to with NO LEAKS, minimal and easy to clean parts, and the bottle vents perfectly as long as the nipple is lined up with the notch. These bottles have a great design to hold a lot of ounces without looking and feeling huge like other brands. Additionally, leakage is a huge problem with other popular brands that I just could not deal with anymore. Most other bottles made my baby fuss and make feedings a sloppy mess. These nipples help the baby to pace their feeding out on their terms and then the milk stops from rolling out of their mouth. It took about a day or two for my baby to get the hang of the nipple but it was totally worth it. Additionally, pay close attention to the flow chart to figure out which nipple will work best for your baby. These bottles saved my sanity!"

The nipples are slow feed which are supposed to be similar to breastfeeding. Our baby likes them."

I realized that they blended better then this blender bottle does with its mixing ball.  I started using this bottle without the mixing ball.  It mixes better without the mixing ball.  The whey protein I use in this would clump in the wire mixing ball and there would be lumps in the bottom corners of the bottle or just floating around in the mix when I used the ball.  It mixes better without the ball and it's easier to clean without powder in the corner and without the ball.  It might work better if the mixing ball were a blunt caltrop and heavier.  It's easier to swig from this than a mason jar, you won't be pouring too much at once all over yourself or spilling in a gym setting but the cap is hard to unsnap, I need two hands and some concentration."

And thankfully it does not leak! But it doesn't fit in my cup holder in my car, so that's my only complaint. The handle that it comes with is not going to fit your wrist. So you can really only stick your fingers through the loop and hold it that way. Which is fine with me."

I wanted a bottle with a top that screws on like a plastic water bottle because in my experience, that is easier to close than when the top screws inside. For traveling, having a hand strap should make it easier to keep hold of it. I also did NOT want a straw. While a bottle with a straw is great for active situations, I don't like taking pills with a straw. I was impressed with the leak proof performance when I had partially closed it late at night and it slipped out of my hand and fell, but didn't leak. It is also insulated, keeping the water cold all night. The only challenge is that on my uninsulated metal water bottles, I can guess the fill level from my refrigerator spout by the location of the cooler part of the bottle. This one got overfilled the first time I used it because there is no temperature differential on the outside during filling."

I tote it around with me everywhere, and it's a great size for that (just barely fits in my purse and doesn't leak) and keeps my water cold for a while, which my old bottle didn't do. Despite my best efforts, I've already dropped it on gravel once in the few weeks since I got it, which chipped the paint and only barely dented the metal, so hopefully this is sturdier than my other bottle, too. I like the twist cap style as opposed to a straw or anything else because this style is easier to clean. My one gripe is that the cap can be difficult to twist off when it's slippery, because it has no ridges to grip."

If you have smaller hands like my wife you may not like it since she can't drink from it one handed.

I use the flip top lid and compared to the basics lid it's great since it's one handed operation to open and close. The other lids are just taking up space in storage but at least if this one breaks I'll have backups instead of having to buy a whole nother bottle. I've dropped it a few times and the finish seems to have held up great, though upon closer inspection there is a small scratch that I only noticed because I was looking for it.

        "content": "I purchased the black 64oz bottle and have been using this bottle daily for about two months now. It has great and has met all my expectations. I’m currently living in a tropical climate which means it’s hot and humid all the time. So I needed a large bottle to keep my beverages cold and so I could stay hydrated throughout the day. Since I’ve gotten this bottle I’ve been drinking over a gallon a day.I love that this bottle does not sweat, leaving rings or pools of water behind like non-insulated bottles do. The coating on the bottle looks nice and adds grip which makes holding it easy even when full. This bottle comes with lots of accessories for using and clean adding to the quality and value of this product vs the last one I owned from a different brand.Lids:I love that it comes with multiple caps/lids that are easy to swap out depending on the use. I use the flip straw lid while at school where the bottle sits on my desk and im taking frequent sips. When I’m at home I set it down a lot and so I’m drinking from it less frequently but at greater volume so that’s where the spout lid comes in handy.The paracord handle: It’s a great addition that my previous bottle from a different brand didn’t have and makes carrying it very easy and convenient. Additionally, im apprehensive about carrying the bottle by the lid all the time while it’s full because i can only imagine the nightmare it would be if the lid popped off and the bottle hit the ground causing denting it and then having to deal with half a gallon of fluids all over the floor. Now with that being said I have on occasion held the bottle by the lid and I’ve had no issues.Thermo regulation(hot/cold): I’ve never used it with any hot fluids so unfortunately I can’t share any insight on that. As far as keeping beverages cold I have a little insight. Based on how much I’m drinking I’m refilling this bottle more than once a day. So with that being said testing the limits of how long it keeps beverages cold isn’t something I’m doing. The longest I’ve kept fluid in the bottle is about 12 hours. I filled it up a bit before bed and in the morning it seemed just as cold as when it went in.Potential improvements: Due to the structure, size, and weight when it makes contact with another surface it can be a bit clunky or noisy. This can be resolved with foam/fabric cover or another option I’ve seen is a silicone cap that goes over the bottom of the bottle. Both these options aid in shock absorption and reduces any noise. I know people who have each of these on their bottles and they love them.TLDR: This bottle has lots of great features, it’s a good value and has met or exceeded all my expectations. Based on my experience I’d recommend it to family and friends."

I have an insulated 64oz water bottle but it’s so heavy and bulky I barely take it with me unless I’m going to the gym that day bcuz my other bottles only holds 32oz which finishes before I get through half my day. So I decide atleast a 48oz will do. This one isn’t is too heavy and it’s so fancy and cute with 3 different covers and style. I’m so excited about my water bottle. If I had known it wasn’t going to be heavy, Wish I’d bought the 64oz instead. Gave it a 10. I can’t say if it holds cold and hot water for the amount of hours it states but either way I don’t like my water too cold and it’s not for hot water so it definitely works for me."

I changed to the twist cap spout cover so far, no water shaking in cap."

The covers are well made and have a snug fit so it doesn't feel like it will fall out if tipped over (I haven't tested the leak proof myself yet). I do like that they give you 2 covers one with a straw spot plus a flip up opening and the other a sliding opening.-Straws/cleaning brush: all 3 are durable and well made.-Cleaning/diswasher: It's all easy to clean. I like that the cup itself is dishwasher safe.*I'm not sure if the covers or handle are due to the rubber on them, handwashing them is pretty easy with the removal parts on the covers.Overall it's a well made cup and I would recommend it if you're looking for a durable traveling mug with a couple different options for covers/handle design."

        "content": "I wanted a 40oz water bottle that would fit well in the car cup holder. I got this one because I was relatively cheap and had an optional handle, in case I didn't like it. I really do like the handle after all, it's very sturdy and I use it all the time. The whole bottle is easy to clean. The lid I use has a straw hole but I use the chug opening; I open the straw hole also and it serves as a good vent. Neither straw fit snugly in the opening, however. At first I turned the cup upside down and it dripped a bit when all closed up. I have found the best way to put the lid on is: open the lid (or else the pressure builds), push into place and then twist back and forth. This part seems to help the most. Keeping the lid pushed in and open, I just rotate the lid seal against the inside of thr bottle in both directions about 15⁰ or so. Then, the lid makes a good snap when it closes and it seals this way 98% of the time.The only time I've spilled it is when I tried to grab it by the top and the whole lid came off instead. Handle is really helpful if you use it. I haven't dropped it yet which is surprising. I'll update my review if I do."

        "content": "So far so good. Bought 2 in two different sizes as part of a gift. These lovely mugs keep drinks hot or cold.I use the 10 ouncer for my coffee at home. I dont even always use the lid! Just having my hot coffee in a vessel like this is going to keep my drink warmer than a ceramic mug.I really like the handle. It is optional. I like the assortment of colors. I like the slider lid. I dont use metal straws, but I do like that they are included as well as a cleaning brush.Pro tip (for any mug like this): pre heat the cup by putting hot water inside for a couple of minutes, pour out, then add your hot beverage. Starting with a hot interior will keep your drink from being cooled down from cold steel. Want it extra cold? Place in fridge prior to adding cold liquid.Pro tip: Even though all of these mugs always say dishwasher safe and leak proof, they are best when hand washed. Sometimes the coating just doesnt stand up to multiple dishwasher cycles (or may depend on what detergent is used, which cycle, placement, etc). So I just hand wash always. Pretty much always. Not that I have had any problems with this, but why chance it? As for not leaking. Well, more of a comment than a tip-- these lids (on any brand) arent made to be truly leak proof. They are all made the same pretty much. If it tips, it might not leak, if you hold it upside down it probably will leak or maybe not. Dont plan on tossing this in a gym bag or purse and expect no leakage, that is just silly.So yeh, overall I think they are fine. And again I tend to find them nearly all the same, I just shop for ones with slider lids (my preference) and best price/colors"

I purchased this type of thermal container, where instead of making coffee everyday I use my coffee maker to make hot tea instead with black caffeinated tea bags in its coffee carafe or loose teas where id normally put coffee granuals.I began drinking coffee at 45yo, and after a recent panic attack I decided to stop drinking coffee and turned to teas at 64yo, something that's helped me in more ways than ever now.But I needed to find a way to keep it hot during the winter months. Almost bought the more expensive Standleys, glad I looked around more to find pretty much the same type of containers for half the price. It's becomethe most convenient way of consuming hot beverages for me at home and on the run, as well. I got the silicone tips for the metal straws but I'm finding out I prefer consuming hot tea while at home without a straw, but I do use the straws while driving.Now I've become a sort of tea connoisseur where I'm buying organic medicinal teas for morning, evenings, symptoms(anxiety), etc.. that aren't expensive at all, and they stay the right temperature throughout the day thanks to these inexpensive artsy thermal containers.

I have another Thermos (40oz) that I've had for a decade and love that is too large for use in a vehicle, but keeps things hot 22 hrs and cold for the same amount of time.I wanted something similar, just for smaller drinks  16oz is never enough, so 24oz, (3 cups) seemed like a reasonable size that would still fit into a vehicle cup holder and be spill proof.The top is all plastic, so I'm a little disappointed about that and there's just the large opening which really can't be used for HOT liquids due to the huge flow, but would be great for cold liquids (which is what this is sold as).  Too bad.  If they included a little hole for air or even a straw, then this could easily be dual use.The lid screws on in about 1/2 a turn and won't leak from what I've seen so far.  I have doubts about the very top lid lasting.  It is hard plastic and I can see a drop from 3ft causing it to crack at the least and shatter at the most.The bottom is Thermos quality - construction. Stainless steel inside, beautiful outside and non-slip base.  If only the top were the same quality.To have my hot tea, looks like I'll need to bring a normal cup with me and risk spills while driving or sipping from the wide-mouth that a normal cup provides.Hopefully, Thermos makes a not-too-expensive replacement lid for hot liquids that will fit this.

I put them in my Salomon adv skin 12, they were a little tight fit just fine. I was able to bend the straw and use the retention straps on the skin 12 vest. If you do use them in a vest I found I the straws flapped if I didnt make sure the slightly firm oval tops of the bottles weren't all the way down in my vest.

I found that screwing the tops off and on to not be as smooth as the flasks that came with my vest but I only unscrewed them when cleaning them so this really isn't a complaint just an FYI.  The pop top enclosures worked great for refueling during my race and gave me zero issues. I opted to go with the 600ml and I'm happy I did as it fits my vest without issue and provides 200ml extra between the two."

Its kind of annoying at first, it's generally easy to avoid when you're aware of the issue but it can be easy to forget when you're running miles in the douple digits which is kind of the point in wearing your water while running. I would probably still give them 5 stars even with this issue because the ease of disassembly makes them easy to clean. My main gripe is the plastic taste. I've worn them about 10 times, washed them twice, and I'm still getting a very strong plastic taste. If you're looking for a flask to fit in a running vest I would highly recommend them as they are very easy to drink from on the go, but if you had another purpose in mind I think you could do better."

I’m a convert from Life Factory glass water bottles because despite preferring glass, the silicone cover on the Life Factory bottles doesn’t protect enough from my clumsiness and not only have I broken several, they spill easily either from coming open in my bag or while drinking. The Yeti lid design is genius in that it has a wide mouth for cleaning and filling, and a smaller opening for drinking. I also love that it’s truly dishwasher safe and the paint color (mine is white) shows no signs of chipping like other stainless painted/colored bottles. My only complaint is that it doesn’t fit in a cup holder in my cars."

Hydro flask is good for working out, around the house or office. Lululemon falls into the same category. They are both designed well, have an assortment of colors, etc.The yeti rambler… If you want some thing that will last and even several YouTube videos of all confirm go with a rambler. The yeti falls into hiking, camping and survival category as well. Not that the others can’t be used , but they will get damage in places where the yeti will not.So durability is definitely in this product.As for function, I really like the removable top that has an anchor point for carabiners and perfect fit for your hand to unscrew. Once the top is removed there is another top with a bottle like opening. It works perfectly for drinking on the go without it splashing out, and for pouring. Another plus it is see-through. I worked in 100° weather with room temperature or ice-cool liquid and it stays cool for the workday. I have also experienced the same with coffee and tea…but staying warm. Margaritas stay delicious and shaken too!As for looks, I see these in the gym all the time, vinyl stickers can be added for customization, good selection of color and it doesn’t feel cheaply painted. The paint will not scratch easily put it that way. Stainless steel bottom is unique and traditional classy looking.Easy to clean and your fingers and a sponge fits to the bottom. Very happy with the Yeti"

        "content": "I purchased these for my kids this fall to take to school. Their prior bottles were too small (about 12 oz) and they had to keep refilling them, so we wanted something bigger. I found these and they are PERFECT. The lock + button-to-open feature is secure and there have been NO leaks in the backpack. Since they are steel they don't crack like cheap plastic ones do when the kids toss their backpacks on the ground and we don't use plastics for food or beverages in our house anyway. The best feature is there is no straw to clean. The spout feature make it easier to clean too. I have noticed that the kids are drinking much more water - maybe because the water stays colder or because it's easier to take large gulps compared to a straw. My 12yo says the water tastes much better compared to some we have tried with silicone straws.  I bought it on sale on Amazon for $18 each at the time, which I thought was really reasonable for what you get. The Stanley brand is well known for lasting a REALLY long time. Unless plastic parts on the lid break (they haven't yet and they seem really sturdy) I see this bottle being around for years."

The cap potentially could come off on the bottom and they COULD potentially expose someone to lead.As far as the reviews stating the lid hits them on the nose, this is not true at all for me.  The lid actually locks into place when you open it and isn't even relying on the spring to hold it.  It does not come down at all for me and I really have no complaints about the thermos.  Keeps the drinks cold, it's a good size and the locking mechanism and overall functionality is great."

        "content": "Great water bottle.  I've owned it for 3 months now and I am very happy with it.  It hasn't leaked on me yet, even when full and laying on its side.  This is my second Stanley purchase and I am very satisfied with the product quality on both items.Pros: - doens't leak - can use one handed - fits in my backpack side pocket and in every cup holder I've tried - locks tightly - handle makes it easy to carry - easy to (hand) washCons: - noisy (I'll explain below)Noise Issue:There is one design flaw, I write this in the hopes that someone from Stanley will read this and modify this item slightly.  There's a thin metal bar that locks the bottle closed.  The lock works fine.  The problem is that this thin metal bar bangs against the stainless steel portion of the water bottle.  Ting!  Ting!  Ting!This happens when I have it in my car's cup holder due to vibrations while driving, this happens when I carry the bottle by its handle, basically whenever the bottle is moving when it's not locked.I can fix the problem by keeping the bottle locked, but I don't always want to keep it locked - that's two more steps every time I open and close the bottle!I solved the noise problem with a hack - I have a silicon wristband around the bottle, positioned at the point where the metal bar makes contact with the stainless steel.  It still bangs when moving, but it barely makes any noise.  Still, it would be cool if Stanley fixed the issue on their end."

I have several of the Simple Modern Kona cups and while I love those, they are not large capacity, I found myself re-filling 5-7 times a time, more when the summer hits.  So I got this one which is 24oz instead of 16oz.  So far it's perfect for my needs.  The only issue I have is that the bottle is a bit wider than my cup holder in my hot tub as well as my car, it sits, but doesn't feel stable in there."

It has a large twist off top so it’s easy to fill with ice from the ice fridge machine. While at the gym, you can just push a button to have access to the mouth piece, so not only is the mouth piece covered so it doesn’t spill, you don’t have to twist anything or touch the mouth piece with gym hands. Also my other favorite feature is the metal ring attached to the cover, that’s how I carry the water bottle around at the gym. When working out I don’t really want to touch the equipment and handle my water bottle so this just lessens those touch points! Also water stays plenty cold while at the gym! Super cute and functional! 10/10 great addition to anyone’s water bottle collection!"

And thankfully it does not leak! But it doesn't fit in my cup holder in my car, so that's my only complaint. The handle that it comes with is not going to fit your wrist. So you can really only stick your fingers through the loop and hold it that way. Which is fine with me."

I wanted a bottle with a top that screws on like a plastic water bottle because in my experience, that is easier to close than when the top screws inside. For traveling, having a hand strap should make it easier to keep hold of it. I also did NOT want a straw. While a bottle with a straw is great for active situations, I don't like taking pills with a straw. I was impressed with the leak proof performance when I had partially closed it late at night and it slipped out of my hand and fell, but didn't leak. It is also insulated, keeping the water cold all night. The only challenge is that on my uninsulated metal water bottles, I can guess the fill level from my refrigerator spout by the location of the cooler part of the bottle. This one got overfilled the first time I used it because there is no temperature differential on the outside during filling."

I tote it around with me everywhere, and it's a great size for that (just barely fits in my purse and doesn't leak) and keeps my water cold for a while, which my old bottle didn't do. Despite my best efforts, I've already dropped it on gravel once in the few weeks since I got it, which chipped the paint and only barely dented the metal, so hopefully this is sturdier than my other bottle, too. I like the twist cap style as opposed to a straw or anything else because this style is easier to clean. My one gripe is that the cap can be difficult to twist off when it's slippery, because it has no ridges to grip."

This bottle lets me refill from a gallon jug and even add some chocolate syrup for a treat.  The seal doesn't leak and it keeps the milk cold until lunchtime.  I also like how it is 12oz, so she gets more milk than the individual 8oz boxes.  My daughter loves the color! The only con is the height, as that makes it difficult to fit into some lunch boxes."

        "title": "Great size but doesn’t keep water hot",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I really like the size and color designs. I’m so happy this fits in the car’s cup holder. I’ve been searching for an insulated water bottle that fits in the car’s cup holder without an extender and is dishwasher safe and has a twist cap for a long time and finally found the perfect fit with these bottles. These are such a great size and they’re really easy to grip and hold in one hand because the circumference is not wide like others.I don’t need all the caps and straws etc. but it’s nice to have options I guess. I only like to use the twist cap because I feel like that’s the only cap that can be cleaned well in the dishwasher. I don’t like the other options because I don’t feel like it would clean well in the dishwasher and I don’t want to hand wash them. It would be better if there was a cheaper option to choose just one type of cap.The cap has a nice rigid handle. I have another water bottle that has a soft rubber like handle that flops to the side all the time and gets in the way. This one doesn’t get in the way and stays in place. It’s very stiff and sometimes a little hard to move but still works well. It also doesn’t make my water taste like plastic when the condensation drips into the water bottle. My other brand cap does and it’s a little concerning that I could be drinking plastic. This one sometimes has a little tiny bit of plastic taste but nothing like my other cap. If manufacturers can somehow figure out a way to make the inside of the cap stainless steel too, then that would be perfect.The insulation works okay. I fill the water bottle approximately with 13 oz of hot water at 8:15 am and by 12 pm it’s warm. The 13 oz of water is made up of approximately 9 oz of boiling hot water and 4 oz of room temperature water, so the water is still pretty hot but it just doesn’t stay that temperature less than 4 hours later. A lot of these types of insulated water bottles don’t hold the same temperature for the stated amount of time they advertise and this one is no different. It still works because I don’t want it that hot by lunch time but it would be better if it worked the way it is stated.I also tried filling it with 13 oz of only boiling water to see if it works any better. The temperature is hotter than when I put the mixture. By lunch time it’s a drinkable hot temperature where you can only drink medium sips without burning your tongue or throat. After I filled it with straight hot boiling water, the mixture I did before is now hotter than before by lunch time; it’s now hot but drinkable instead of just warm. So by lunch time it’s the same as if I put all boiling water.Overall, so far I think this the best insulated bottle I have out of all the water bottles I have. It has a great wide opening so you can fill it easily and it fits all the other features I was looking for: fits in cup holder, insulated, and has a twist cap."

        "title": "The best of both worlds...",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "This set of tumblers is great, I love that it comes with 3 separate tops although admittedly we only use the spout it is nice to know that we have options.  I have also used the flat top once when I took both bottles with me on a trip.  One to drink out of and the other to refill.One of the things I like best about this set of bottles is the carry handle.  I have several bottles that have the side handle but the thing about those bottles is that they are not always convenient to carry in an upright position and if you are using the straw swinging the bottle can cause some to leak out.The set comes with three changeable lids, a plain flat lid, a straw/spout lid that allows you to suck the contents and a sports spout that you just tilt the tumbler up and drink from it or let the liquid free flow out of the bottle if you are sharing it.  The bottles also come with two sets of straws, 4 in all and two brushes that can be used to clean the straws.  I think that initially when the fat straws started to get popular people forgot you needed a way to clean them.  So the brushes are a welcomed addition to the set.The ad says that the bottles are dishwasher safe however I prefer to wash them by hand.  The bottle has a wide mouth opening that helps when filling the bottle with ice.  In addition, I like that no matter how cold the contents of the bottle that the outside would not sweat especially since I often just drop the bottle inside my bag with my books, purse, papers, etc.The bottle can be used for both hot and cold beverages which again is something that you want in a tumbler.  Some of the prices can be extremely high and the versatility is a plus.  This set is very responsibly priced with both bottles costing less than one of the more popular brands.  This particular bottle comes in a variety of colors and several different volumes.  It would have been nice if you could have mixed different-sized bottles in one order.As far as keeping your drinks hot or cold they seem to do well during the course of the day and even retain some coolness in the AM but the ice is generally gone.  Since I use them mainly on the go I am okay with the performance.I give the bottles a 9 rating.  I think I would give a 10 if the bottles fit in the cup holders in the car.  I got the larger bottle and they do not.  All in all though, I would recommend them and buy them again.  I am thinking of buying one for the whole family and having them customized to take on summer vacation."

        "title": "4-in-1 large 27 oz tumblers",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I found the perfect size for my primary or secondary tumbler. I have a tumbler with me at all times, it has coffee in the winter and water in summer. Well sometimes it has a mixed drink as I'm relaxing on the patio. The tumbler I've been using for sometime now is only 20 oz. Don't get me wrong, it works great but is limited in functionality. This two pack of 27 oz tumblers is a great replacement or addition to it. Although I like the smaller size of my 20 oz tumbler, I find so often 20 oz is just not enough. With the BJPKPK I get 7 more ounces. For shorter trips that's enough but for longer trips I'll take my 20 oz and have this 27 oz as a refill unit. Or maybe take both 27 oz units. My reasoning is I still like my 20 oz tumbler because it fits in the cup holder, I don't have oversized cup holders. And I have 27 oz tumblers that are tapered on the bottom, but I feel they are too tall and not comfortable to use. So I like the design of these tumblers because the circumference is wide but still easy to grip and the height is similar to my 20 oz tumbler. The paint on the tumblers feels good and is not slippery when wet. I love the handles and now I have a choice of tops to use for my purpose. 1 top is solid (Flex) to store whatever I want and when needed I can either pour it out or take a drink. The 2nd top is a spout and my favorite to drink from. The spout has a hinged screw cover that takes only a couple of twist to open. The larger hole works great for everything to include iced drinks. Lastly the 3rd lid is the straw lid. It has a mouth spout that flips up when needed and a straw below. The flip motion is smooth and does not leak when closed. In fact none of the lids leaked. Every lid screws on securely and has a handy handle. I've tested with coffee and hours later my coffee was still hot. I've also left ice in the tumbler for over 24 hours and there was still some ice left. I had to do the ice test to compare to my expensive tumbler and I'm pleased these tumblers worked just as well. I really don't see myself using the straw lid, I'm not a straw using guy but the other 2 lids will get tons of use. For those who like the straws, this kit does come with 4 straws and 2 cleaning brushes. These tumblers are a very important addition to my collection and will replace a couple of my older tumblers permanently. I've spent more on 1 tumbler that does half of what these do. Great price for some very nice tumblers."

        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "These bottles are very well made and strong.  The colors match what I see on my screen. On the bottom of the bottles it says dishwasher safe. I put them in the dishwasher before using them for the first time and both of them came out with lighter colored marks shaped like water drops and the bottoms were very faded. These marks and faded spots are permanent and do not wash off.  These need to be hand washed if you want to keep the color nice.  I tested one by filling it with hot water.  The water was measured with a digital meat thermometer.  It started out at 176 degrees and after about 12 hours it was 104 degrees.  The bottle was opened several times during the 12 hours to check the temperature so I expect that the final temperature would have been a bit higher if the bottle was not opened until the 12 hours were over.It came with 6 lids 4 straws and 2 cleaning brushes.  I did not want to mess with having to clean the straws so I chose the lid with no spout and my husband chose one of the lids that has a spout, but works with no straw."

These work very well for that purpose, but not perfectly.  I like pretty much everything about them and will use them often; but they do not live up to the promise of keeping liquids hot or cold for the promised amount of time.  Aside from that, love them; and they do hold the temperature fairly well, at least long enough to last through most of a commute and work day.Something you don't see with every other water bottle is that everything you need to really make use of these is included.  In addition to the two water bottles, there are 3 types of lids for different purposes, reusable straws (2 per bottle), and brushes to clean each straw (have you ever tried to clean a straw without a straw brush?).  Lids are made from heavy material and should last a very long time; they screw on and off easily and make a tight seal even without using much pressure.  The solid lid with a carry handle is very convenient, the one with a straw hole folds down flush to keep liquids from leaking when not being used, and the third with a pour spout has an easy to remove cap for the spout.I got the 22 ounce size which is easy to grip and carry partially because of the size and also because of the powdery outside coating which just feels nice and is non-slip.The liquid temp, as already mentioned, did not hold as long as expected; but was still OK.  In a heated liquid test (see video) I started with 160 F. water poured into a bottle that had been pre-rinsed with the same temp water.  With the solid lid in place, I waited 4 hours and checked the temp which had fallen to 133.  After 18 hours, the temp was at 99 degrees .. still warm but not hot.  I did not test the cold retention but expect similar results.These are very nice liquid bottles at a fair price considering all the added items.  And compared to other similar products, they are a clear winner."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "Since I am very concerned that I stay hydrated, I have for at least 20 years been buying and accumulating water bottles to carry with me to work, use in the car on trips and have around the house, next to my computer and bedside. They all are either 750 ML or one L transparent plastic and start off with a bite valve or similar straw because I like to not have to elevate the liquid; prefer sucking through a straw. And since I use just water and not coffee or tea or any other hot or cold beverage I just rinse them out and refill with water. The water out of my tap is usually room temperature or colder after running a few seconds.The problem has been that due to aging the silicone bite valve becomes loose and leaks air or loses its water seal and begins to leak if I tip it over or just gets lost since it is just held on by friction. And the flexible plastic carrying handle on top breaks so I end up having to replace a lot of parts and make new handles out of webbing and a worm clamp; not a professional look. Furthermore if I wanted to use the water vessel to carry soup or stew I don't have a suitable closure for the top. And the stainless steel vacuum insulated tumblers I have, some from Amazon, are tapered and therefore must be tall to accommodate the 750 ML to 1 L of water I want to carry with me and they don't have a handle and if they have a screw on or press on cap the straw does not seal 100 percent so tends to leak if tipped. And I can wash the bottom in the dishwasher but not the top.Now this tumbler solves all these problems and is dishwasher safe. Each of the two tumblers in this kit came with three different screw on leakproof caps, each with a handle, two straws and a straw cleaning brush. So you get two bottoms, six tops, four straws and two straw cleaning brushes. The inside diameter of the top, 2 inches (5 cm), is the same as my other tumblers. Of the three tops for each tumbler, one is solid and seals perfectly so you could carry soup or stew, the second has a 7/8 inch (22 mm) outside diameter chug type mouthpiece 3/4 inch (19 mm) high to drink out of if you want to invert the tumbler. This mouthpiece, which is smooth on the outside (is threaded on the inside), is tightly sealed by a captive screw cap attached with a hinge; very nice design. The third, Which is the one I use, has a built-in hinged straw mouthpiece with air compensation valve that lowers and seals perfectly with no leaking at all when inverted and shaken. The colors are fully acceptable in professional gatherings.This tumbler fits perfectly in my car's large cupholder, having a uniform cylindrical shape (no taper) with the same 3.5 inch (9 cm) outside diameter as my other 1 L water bottles. And holds 32 ounces (950 ML). The screw caps, besides having strong nonflexible hinged handles also has a nicely textured, easily gripped surface.In conclusion: my new go-to water bottle. Very highly recommend."

        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I received my order two days ago, and I am happy with it. The bottle has a sleek design that fits my hand much better than most of the others I’ve owned. I was disappointed by the size of the bottle opening. It is about an inch and a half wide and I will have to buy a smaller bottle brush to clean it properly. I also couldn't get my smaller ice cubes to fit the narrow opening, so I crushed some ice in the blender. The great news is that the ice stayed frozen for at least ten hours. Today, I didn't feel like chopping ice, so I added some very cold water from my fridge to the bottle, and 6 hours later,  it was still cold. If it's possible to redesign this with a wider mouth, it would be perfect for me. However, if you have a crushed ice option on your fridge or an icemaker with small pellet ice, you should have no problems loading it with ice and enjoying a very cold beverage for several hours. Though, so far, the water in the bottle is still cold, even without any ice. I wrote this review so anyone who must have a wide-mouth bottle understands this particular style may not fit your needs. However, if the narrow opening isn't a deal breaker, this is quite a good bottle that delivers on the promise to keep beverages cold for a reasonable price."

I chose the 25 oz. size, but found the finish too slippery to hold, and it was a little difficult to hold onto due to the larger circumference. It felt a little heavy for me to hold as well. Not saying anyone else will have these same issues, but it was my experience. It's a great product, but I think this one is a little bit too big for me. I'll keep it for a backup. Seal works great and doesn't leak. I'm giving it 5 stars as it works great, I just had some difficulty using it that doesn't affect the rating."

I could see no visible dents but assumed the seal failed due to a drop or bumping it. I was disappointed but eventually bought another and to my dismay it wasn't long before it was no longer keeping things cold either.  I chocked it up to the 640z being too heavy making them easy to damage.  Months after losing a second one due to loss of the seal,  I find myself tempted to buy another.  I love the size and my 32OZ is a champ, but I fear I will be throwing my money away yet again. I would buy another 32, but lugging two around daily would be a chore. Bottom line, it is a great product,  but the large size is heavy and harder to handle."

      "SIZE: This Zak stainless steel water bottle holds 15.5 ounces and measures 4.3 by 2.8 inches wide and 6 inches tall.     MATERIAL: This sports water bottle is made of single-wall, break-resistant 18/8 stainless steel, which is durable and BPA-free. Hand washing is recommended; do not microwave.     HYGIENIC SPOUT COVER: Keep the spout clean in the house or while you're traveling--the spout cover protects contact surfaces and has a flip-up lock that keeps it closed to prevent leaks. When it's time to drink, the action lid allows one-handed operation, and the spout easily pops up at the push of a button; a vent allows liquid to flow freely when the spout is open so kids can easily drink.     BUILT-IN-CARRYING LOOP: The lid has an integrated loop, so this travel water bottle is easy to take on the go. It also fits in most car cup holders, and won't leak when the spout cover is closed and locked, so you can put it in a bag without worrying about mess.     LIFESTYLE: Zak Designs water bottles make hydration fun! This Disney Frozen water bottle is great for any fan of Elsa. The drinkware is fully reusable--no more disposable bottles--and an exciting addition to the daily routine.",

      "Action Lid",
      "The comfortable silicone spout is protected by a spout cover that helps prevent the spread of germs, but easily opens at the push of a button. To stop the cover from opening accidentally, you can hold it in place by flipping up the lock from underneath the button. The lid also has a built-in handle that makes it easy to carry anywhere.",

        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "***Update on this review: I kept getting filters that were too long to fit in the bottle, so I reached out to Brita to see what the problem was. My water bottle originally came with a little round plastic piece inside the straw that looked kind of like a wheel with a knob on one end. The first filter I received along with the water bottle fit perfectly when I used that plastic piece on the bottom of the filter, but according to Brita, that piece isn’t necessary, and now the longer filters can just be put in the straw as is. I’ve also gotten a filter that was flat on the bottom, but they said that the filters should be open at the end. So if your filter doesn’t fit, check to make sure that there’s no plastic wheel piece inside the straw, and if it is, just pop it out and toss it. Hope this helps someone!I bought my Brita water bottle at Target and it came with a filter that fit perfectly. I ordered these replacements when it was time, but they were about a quarter inch too long to fit… The one that originally came with the bottle had just slipped right in with no fuss, but I had to press these ones down pretty hard to be able to lock the cap back on. It was SO difficult to drink from, like trying to suck a milkshake through one of those tiny coffee straws. Finally I just grabbed a knife and cut the end of the filter off until it fit properly, then rinsed it well and popped it back in. That worked! Now it flows like it did when I first got it, and there are no bits of residual charcoal or anything. So if your filters don’t fit, just try trimming it a quarter of an inch or so, and make sure to rinse it thoroughly afterward."

        "title": "My Go-To Water Bottle!",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I have purchased a number of water bottles to try.  This 32 ounce stainless steel Brita bottle is the one for me.First of all, the size is generous yet the bottle feels more compact and portable than other similar sized bottles.  It doesn't feel like a huge bottle to me.  It is bigger than what will fit in my cup holder in the car, but I still find it to be compact enough to be considered portable.I was looking for a bottle that is insulated so that it will keep my water cold for longer.  I wanted to be able to filter water so that funky fountain water or tap water lost most of its funny taste, yet I didn't need something so crazy to filter river water or muddy water.  I also wanted a water bottle that would hold a fairly generous amount of water so that I wasn't refilling all the time.The way that I use this bottle is that I fill with ice in the morning and then sip the cold water.  There are times when I will run out of water yet I still have ice.  Then I just find a sink or fountain, refill, and go again.  Ice stays in the bottle all day, and my water is cold all day also.  I have had ice in the bottle 24 hours later, so I feel that it does keep the water cold all day.My transition from soft drinks to water has occurred over about six months, but now I find that I am drinking water all throughout the day.  I don't measure my water intake, but I sip my water throughout the day.  I fill my bottle 2-3 times a day.  This is in addition to what I drink at lunch and dinner.I do not have issues with my water bottle leaking, EXCEPT when I over fill the bottle.  Then when I am screwing the lid on the bottle, there is water that overflows and leaks from the cap.  Once the overflow is gone, the bottle does not leak.I don't run my bottle through the dishwasher although if you feel comfortable running your insulated tumblers through the dishwasher, you might not mind running this one through as well.I wasn't sure at first how I felt about the straw and sipping instead of being able to chug my water; however, as it turns out, that wasn't really a concern at all.  I don't consider it difficult to draw up the water to drink through the straw as some have indicated.On the whole, this insulated water bottle has emerged the leader of the pack for me.  It feels solidly made.  It is generous in size and, starting the day with ice in the bottle, keeps me in cold drinking water all day.  It doesn't leak and isn't easy to spill. It isn't unwieldy to carry and doesn't sweat.I definitely feel that I am doing a small part to help the environment since I am decreasing my use of plastic single-use water bottles.There is nothing about this bottle that is a negative for me.Update:  I have been using this bottle daily for more than six months. From dawn to dark, I have this bottle with me everywhere I go. I quit drinking soda altogether and truly crave my ice cold water. My bottle has a few dings from being dropped a few times, but it’s still going strong. It still keeps my water cold for 24 hours. I don’t have any odd discoloration or moldy spots on the mouthpiece. Finding replacement filters has been exceptionally easy, and I have a bi-monthly reminder on my calendar to replace my filter. I love the carry loop, which makes this slightly larger bottle highly portable. Ultimately, I can see the “fail” will occur on the cap hinges, as my bottle already has hairline fractures on each hinge.I tried the 20 ounce bottle, and it simply does not hold enough water for me. I purchased a cup holder extender, so now I can rest my bottle in a cup holder while traveling.It isn’t a matter of if I would buy this bottle again but when I will buy another one. This is not a purchase I regret making. My only regret will come if I need this bottle again and can no longer purchase one. For my hydration, I need this bottle (and filter), ice, and tap water."

        "content": "I had an early plastic model that didn't get the suction right with air transfer and it frequently created a vacuum that caused it to leak. And I loved the straw feature with the built in filter so I put up with it or left the lid loose to increase air flow when using. (Also a leak hazard when knocked over.) This bottle does not have that issue at all and as an added bonus, the double insulation keeps my water colder longer and is much more durable than the plastic one.It almost fits in my car cup holder so if that's important to you, be wary. I was hoping this one for 20 oz would fit, but it doesn't. It does fit in my husband's car however.So far it's been easy to clean with a bottle brush. I wish the lid was more accessible for deep cleaning, but it will work for my purposes. The pop lid already keep the spout cleaner than the one I had that left the lid exposed.I affectionately call this my emotional support water bottle. I may very well have to get another in a bigger size."

        "content": "Having a love for water can be rather costly. I spent, in the last two months, almost 200$ buying bottled water because I live out of a hotel and let me tell you, hotel water is not meant to be ingested. I have another water bottle but... The downside with it is, is that I can add ice and it quickly melts in less than an hour and I work at a hotel, irony, and hate having to walk all the down the hall to refill that bottle. Trying to be more environmentally friendly, I do what I can to limit how much waste I contribute. So, looking for a better way to enjoy my water and have it be both kind to the Earth and also convenient for me and my ice loving needs.The water is crisp and the first time I used it, I could barely taste the translucent fluid! It was like...I was drinking down air. It was so refreshing. Now, I will be a little sad that I won't be drinking Essentia or the Smart water +ph, but it's worth it.I only bought it a few days ago and I love this! It keeps the water chilled, cold enough but not too cold, which is what I love. It's pink and adorable! And if you can't already tell, I've already decorated it with some Genshin stickers, which I also bought. Easy open and knowing that the filter lasts two months, means that I don't have to worry about spending more money on bottles of water! Yay! The filter replacements are affordable, so that in itself saves a lot of wasted plastic.I did buy the 20oz because I needed something that was easy for me to carry around in my backpack, so the only con, but not a big deal, is that you have to refill the bottle ALOT throughout the day if you're a big water drinker like I am. Spending 30$ on the bottle is worth the price and I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed."

        "content": "I think I got this a year or two ago and have been using it daily since. It’s still in amazing condition, with just a few scratches to the pink outer coating. The cap, handle, and straw are all still in perfect condition though I should note I never carry it by the handle. My partner also has this same bottle in black and frequently carries his by the little strap / handle— his DID break off on one end, seemingly unfixable, but that happened fairly recently relative to how long he had it without any issues.The filters are easy to replace and last pretty long. I admit I am not always super on top of replacing them as often as suggested but I’ve never noticed any difference or degradation of quality by the end of a filter. It does keep my water cool much longer than a plastic water bottle, but I haven’t paid much attention to how long specifically, as I prefer room temperature water anyway.The bottle has a great look and feel too. It’s very sleek and fits nicely in my daily tote bag. It is a bit heavy due to the material. The walls are also pretty thick, so it won’t hold as much as you may expect it to from just looking at it.**TIP: Regarding the straw— neither my partner nor I initially realized that the straw is meant to “screw” into the cap. He was drinking from it with the straw just sort of shoved into the cap. I hadn’t noticed that specifically bc I never put his together but did think felt odd when I drank from it, because it was very “airy” and felt like it had really awful pull / pressure. I was honestly really shocked at how bad it seemed. When I finally had a chance to look closer, I realized the straw is meant to turn into grooves on the cap (you turn it counter-clockwise) which locks it into place + creates a seal, thus fixing this “issue.” We felt silly upon realizing this… It’s probably pretty intuitive or maybe you’re someone who reads instructions, so you’ll likely be fine, but I still felt it was worth mentioning in case it helps anyone else, haha!"

        "content": "[6 mo. UPDATE]6 months later, the bottle is still perfect! I briefly experienced the issue that some other reviewers mentioned, which was having to use way too much suction to get the water through the straw. This issue appeared 3 months into my using the bottle. Then, I realized that I was 1 month overdue in changing my filter! When I changed the filter, the suction returned to completely normal and effortless. I don't know if something happens with the filter that makes the suction different or if the filter had just moved around in there and made suction difficult. However, I have not had the issue again and have since changed my filter at the recommended 2-month intervals. I have had 0 real issues with this bottle. I also had no issues with the 24 oz. non-insulated, plastic version of this bottle which I had for about a year prior to buying this steel version.----This bottle is PERFECT! I originally had the plastic, translucent 24 oz. Brita bottle which was great, but I was refilling it so often that I wanted a larger one. I saw this one and read that it was insulated which made it a definite plus! This bottle/filter definitely makes even the grossest water (aka hospital water) drinkable and tasty.The mouth on this one seems slightly larger than the 24 oz. because I don’t drop as many ice cubes when putting the bottle under the dispenser.Not only is this insulated, but it doesn’t sweat! The plastic one does sweat and leaves water rings on tables. This steel one keeps my ice perfectly in place for about 3 hours but keeps my water cold for about 7 hours (at this point, there’s still ice left, but just less of it) and keeps it cool for about 3 more hours.I have had 0 (ZERO) issues drinking from the bottle. Someone else mentioned that if you are having difficulty drinking from it, it’s likely because you haven’t twisted the straw in (as directed on the wide end of the straw).  If the water gets extremely low, with like 1 sip remaining, you do have to keep the bottle leveled to be able to drink that sip.The only issue I have with this bottle is so far not seeing a fill line. The fill line in the plastic one is obvious and you can see exactly to where you’re filling the bottle. I have yet to see a fill line in this steel one so I’m not certain how to get the most water in there without overflowing. I just eyeball it.Someone also mentioned the top of the bottle being in the way of their nose… but you can literally extend the top back a full 180°; there’s no way anyone’s nose is that big to be in the way — your nose would have to hook downwards to the level of your lower lip. I’ll try to post pictures later."

I do best with the classic squeeze bottle but don’t like the lack of insulation to keep my beverage of choice cool or cold. Plus the plastic can change the taste if out in the sun (probably a not a healthy situation to be honest).Now I will say o had there older bottle and the drinking nozzle was perfectly round, glass bottle like, and I loved it! Until I dropped it, moment of silence please. This new bottle has a spout that’s more tear shaped (my guess to allow for more air flow thus faster drinking), and it definitely does that. But now I do find I have occasional shirt dribbles again, sad on red drink days.Other than that, this perfect for the gym and for giving me a cold drink after sitting in a hot truck while running errands.Best of luck to y’all!"

After doing so, I checked the integrity of the water seal and unfortunately, the Stash leaks profusely at the screw top. It does not take much pressure to force water to spill out. It's not a lot, but it is annoying. The Stow (500ml flask), however remains solid - no leaks after 1 machine wash."

Many have components that are not dishwasher safe) The lid of this bottle is large enough that I can even scrub the interior with a sponge if needed which I don't have since I can toss it in the dishwasher)-Leak proof - this bottle goes into a backpack to work daily and has not leaked-The 36 oz is large enough for a work day's water (similar to a 1 liter Essentia or Smartwater) and filling it up is easier due to the large lid that unscrews. That way, you are not trying to direct water inside the mouth access. This makes for a great way to get water at the airport or any facilities with the water filling stations-The bottle is sturdy, no dents or scratches (I have the stainless one which I find resists scratches better), the lid has a comfortable handle for carryingThis one is large, so will not fit in a car cup holder and the diameter may be large for smaller hands. I carry it via the lid but there are also smaller ones available which I have as well-Stainless does not retain odors or flavors after washing (I found the plastic refillable ones always taste like plastic or dish soap no matter how many times I washed it)-This one comes with a chug cap but Yeti makes different lids you can buy that universally fit the rambler series. I also bought a magdock cap lid which is similar to a regular water bottle with magnetic lid.-The cost is more than many others available, but at 50$, the cost is worth it for me due to the quality, leak proof, easily refillable, fully dishwasher safe, durability, and the fact that you can buy different lids for the Rambler series bottles and they fit no matter the size of the bottle!"

It's solid, keeps things cold a long time, can take a(n accidental) beating and still look great, and it's easy to take places (the car, the beach, hikes, etc.).The chug cap - which I don't have on my other Yeti - makes it even better.The whole set up is easy to clean (I hand wash them) and dries quickly.Are they a little more pricey than some other brands?  Sure.  But this is a case where the price is worth it because the quality and durability can't be beat."

        "content": "I have two plans for this bottle. One is to replace the plastic water bottle I keep at my bedside and the other is for travel. I wanted a bottle with a top that screws on like a plastic water bottle because in my experience, that is easier to close than when the top screws inside. For traveling, having a hand strap should make it easier to keep hold of it. I also did NOT want a straw. While a bottle with a straw is great for active situations, I don't like taking pills with a straw. I was impressed with the leak proof performance when I had partially closed it late at night and it slipped out of my hand and fell, but didn't leak. It is also insulated, keeping the water cold all night. The only challenge is that on my uninsulated metal water bottles, I can guess the fill level from my refrigerator spout by the location of the cooler part of the bottle. This one got overfilled the first time I used it because there is no temperature differential on the outside during filling."

I tote it around with me everywhere, and it's a great size for that (just barely fits in my purse and doesn't leak) and keeps my water cold for a while, which my old bottle didn't do. Despite my best efforts, I've already dropped it on gravel once in the few weeks since I got it, which chipped the paint and only barely dented the metal, so hopefully this is sturdier than my other bottle, too. I like the twist cap style as opposed to a straw or anything else because this style is easier to clean. My one gripe is that the cap can be difficult to twist off when it's slippery, because it has no ridges to grip."

If you have smaller hands like my wife you may not like it since she can't drink from it one handed.

I use the flip top lid and compared to the basics lid it's great since it's one handed operation to open and close. The other lids are just taking up space in storage but at least if this one breaks I'll have backups instead of having to buy a whole nother bottle. I've dropped it a few times and the finish seems to have held up great, though upon closer inspection there is a small scratch that I only noticed because I was looking for it. On a solid color it may be more obvious. Wide mouth makes it easy to fill and clean."

I’m currently living in a tropical climate which means it’s hot and humid all the time. So I needed a large bottle to keep my beverages cold and so I could stay hydrated throughout the day. Since I’ve gotten this bottle I’ve been drinking over a gallon a day.I love that this bottle does not sweat, leaving rings or pools of water behind like non-insulated bottles do. The coating on the bottle looks nice and adds grip which makes holding it easy even when full. This bottle comes with lots of accessories for using and clean adding to the quality and value of this product vs the last one I owned from a different brand.Lids:I love that it comes with multiple caps/lids that are easy to swap out depending on the use. I use the flip straw lid while at school where the bottle sits on my desk and im taking frequent sips. When I’m at home I set it down a lot and so I’m drinking from it less frequently but at greater volume so that’s where the spout lid comes in handy.The paracord handle: It’s a great addition that my previous bottle from a different brand didn’t have and makes carrying it very easy and convenient. Additionally, im apprehensive about carrying the bottle by the lid all the time while it’s full because i can only imagine the nightmare it would be if the lid popped off and the bottle hit the ground causing denting it and then having to deal with half a gallon of fluids all over the floor. Now with that being said I have on occasion held the bottle by the lid and I’ve had no issues.Thermo regulation(hot/cold): I’ve never used it with any hot fluids so unfortunately I can’t share any insight on that. As far as keeping beverages cold I have a little insight. Based on how much I’m drinking I’m refilling this bottle more than once a day. So with that being said testing the limits of how long it keeps beverages cold isn’t something I’m doing. The longest I’ve kept fluid in the bottle is about 12 hours. I filled it up a bit before bed and in the morning it seemed just as cold as when it went in.Potential improvements: Due to the structure, size, and weight when it makes contact with another surface it can be a bit clunky or noisy. This can be resolved with foam/fabric cover or another option I’ve seen is a silicone cap that goes over the bottom of the bottle. Both these options aid in shock absorption and reduces any noise. I know people who have each of these on their bottles and they love them.TLDR: This bottle has lots of great features, it’s a good value and has met or exceeded all my expectations. Based on my experience I’d recommend it to family and friends."

Reason for 4-Star is due to the issue that the cover collects water during washing. The positive side with this is that it does not leak back into the bottle or leak outside of the bottle. I changed to the twist cap spout cover so far, no water shaking in cap."

I do not often leave reviews, but for this one I will attempt to better explain the logistics of why each feature that I can appreciate actually has endless negative reviews on.PRODUCT REVIEWS, WHEN IT COMES TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS, OFTEN REFLECT A MISUNDERSTANDING OF FUNCTIONAL PURPOSE/ USE/ OPERATION.My intention is to show that every negatively review I have read is just that.  LID / LEAK-PROOF / STRAW / AIRTIGHT SEAL :▪︎ STRAW~It is a 3-piece straw with simple assembly. ALSO, IT IS NOT TOO SHORT, NOR TOO LONG FOR THAT VERY REASON!! The silicone tip that goes at the bottom can be adjusted to fit correctly.  AIRTIGHT SEAL & ONE-HANDED open/close FUNCTION ALOND WITH THE (optional) STRAW ALL WORK TOGETHER SIMULTANEOUSLY!  (One you understand that then you will see the purposes in the overall design)  LEAKPROOF / QUARANTINED AMOUNT OF TIME TO HOLD HOT & COLD FOR SPECIFIED TIME***With the flip top lid closed this thermos has a 100% airtight seal***THE ONE-HANDED FUNCTION OF THE LID MAKES IT QUICK & SIMPLE TO CLOSE IN BETWEEN SIPS.  This is helpful in all of these features, and more!☆ it may be helpful to try using without the straw for a short while to get in the habit of doing this☆ALSO, THIS APPLIES TO THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE LID BREAKING EASILY, BEING PLASTIC (there is no need for a different material than plastic for the lid either! The small rubber stopper on the inside closes again the tip of the straw... creates that airtight seal, and serves as the final part that helps to retain heat & cold)  { yes, it's on the heavy side, but not when you consider the insulation, size (compare ounces capacity with your other insulated mugs and you'll see that this was holds more volume), and materials} LASTLY, THE ATTACHED PHOTO OF THE LARGE, DOUBLE SILICONE ICE MOLD IS MY SUGGESTION FOR ANY ELSE WHO WILL BE USING THE THERMOS AROUND THE CLOCK...  ☆ #6  ⚫️ and #6 ⬛️ ice cubes 5cm in diameter. I ONLY HAVE TO ADD MORE ICE APPROPRIATELY EVERY 24-30 HOURS ☆  ALSO, AS FOR IT NOT HOLDING ICE VERY LONG:¤ ARE YOU USING A TYPICAL/ STANDARD SIZE ICE CUBES? IF SO, HOW MANY?These are high volume (they hold far more than most insulated mugs & thermos! Check the capacity of volume in most every one and you will better understand why you may need to start with more ice in these.ALSO, PEOPLE, PLEASE DO TAKE A MOMENT TO CONSIDER THE LOGISTICS BEHIND PRODUCT DESIGN SO THAT YOU CAN GET THE MOST OUT OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF!IT'LL SAVE YOU FROM FRUSTRATION, DISAPPOINTMENT, TIME, HASTLE & SPENDING MONEY UNNECESSARILY WHEN THINGS DO NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED & EXPECTED! AND IT WILL HELP THE MAKERS OF THE PRODUCTS AGAINST NEGATIVE REVIEWS THAT MAY NOT BE VALID!  please remember also...When you purchase online, make sure that you are reviewing correctly! Is your review of the product, the packaging, the shipping, or the seller themselves?Label it as such so that others can determine what you have stated, why, about what OR about whom?MORE OFTEN THAN NOT YOU WILL GET YOUR ISSUES RESOLVED MORE EASILY, MORE QUICKLY, MORE EFFECTIVELY, AND TO YOUR SATISFACTION BY SIMPLY MAKING CERTAIN THAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE PROPERLY ADDRESSED!Companies do not make money by ripping their customers off! A solid company makes money off happy, loyal, repeat customers!They do, however, loose money from people claiming that their product is bad, or the features are not as advertised simply because you did not take a moment to consider whether or not you may understand its functionality."

        "content": "Silly squat HUGE bottle (yes, I only got the 20 oz) with ingenious straw.1. I love the straw. It's brilliant. For those who can't get it closed, face it the opposite way and it closes fine.(1B- It [straw] does hold smells. I guess your really have to soak it overnight with a not-strong detergent, or have a dedicated bottle for tea/coffee/water.)2. I cannot hold it with one hand to drink from. So it is difficult to handle one handed, especially with the handle in the way. One would need to just keep it open or something, but then I need two hands to pick it up. And it is HEAVY. So the liquid you put in it doesn't really make that huge of a difference in weight, as it is already really heavy and clunky.3. The handle is useful on top. I'm not sure the bulkiness equals insulation for hot liquids- I've had coffee and tea in here, and so far they only keep warm about 3h, but will check this.  Meh. I'd be happier to deal with its bulk if it worked better as advertised 8h hot.4. I got it since it seems impossible to knock over, and I frequently have a coffee mug sitting on the piano bench next to me at work. People who are whizzing by constantly knock it over, which is just aggravating. I think this solves that issue (if I keep it long enough to use as intended.)5. I think the shape helps it fit into my work bag better, but again I'm not sure about this- it's MUCH wider than I thought, in person. Also I don't think I have to worry about it leaking (but I'm not sure about this either. Will update!)"

While I like the sports bottle style that is flexible and you can squeeze like the philips one I have, I don't like how it leaks a lot after a short amount of use (handwashed of course). This one you can drink from easily, like a traditional bottle of water.The water tastes great. I've tested it again the tap water I put it pre-filter. It tastes like bottled water, or filtered through a brita of some sort. Installing filter is easy. There are no leaks at all. It's easy to use and to make sure that it doesn't leak. The cost is appropriate. I'm really happy with this. Although I received mine for free. I bought a second one for myself.A tip - if you don't like the speed at which it comes out (maybe a little slow), hold the water bottle upside down momentarily and the filter will fill up and the water comes out as fast as any water bottle. Kind of fun to do actually as the bubbles go through. I mean it when I say this thing is perfect. Thank you Contigo for making what I've wanted for a while!"

My kids (ranging from 9-16 yrs) have used these the last 1.5 yrs every single day of school/soccer practice/park days/etc, and my boys aren’t exactly gentle with them. Water stays cold for a long time, especially with ice. ZERO LEAKS, ZERO MOLD, ZERO COMPLAINTS. That being said, we only put water in them. No juice, milk, etc, which can breed mold much easier, especially if left uncleaned. I just now took these pics and aside from minor scratches, these things look great! The rubber ring at the bottom of the blue one got lost and it’s too bad because we all really like that feature. Much quieter when you set the metal bottle down and the rubber helps the bottle stay in the mesh pockets of their backpacks instead of sliding out. I actually came back to buy a 4th for my Kindergartner and figured I’d leave a review. Very happy with them! (And way cheaper than some other water bottle brands.) Would definitely recommend!"

I ordered a larger size of this first, but it was too heavy for older hands. This one is perfect. I had ordered the Contigo bottle to try as well, but it was more difficult to drink from as the lid got in the way of my nose. This product's lid fold back and stays in place so that the drinking spout is exposed and easy to drink from. Highly recommend."

        "content": "I have a bigger Takeya Actives bottle but wanted a smaller one for short walks and saw this one on sale. I love the size - easier to carry around with it's attached handle and easy to drink from with it's wide mouth. It has a screw top which I prefer so I know it's locked down. It unscrews easy, but it's not instant, if that's what you are looking for.In hot weather -- say 85+ ice will melt over a few hours. Specific time will depend on how much ice you start with - more takes longer, of course. This is a bit disappointing to me, and why I didn't give it 5 stars. To be fair I've never tried other \"top name\" brand bottles to be able to compare.  At room temp, though,  ice will stay frozen for a day. More importantly, water always stays cold for a day as advertised.This bottle does not sweat and, as with all Actives line bottles, it has a sweat-proof lid too, which makes it great for hot and cold beverages, though I don't use mine for hot beverages. It's strictly water. However, it is dishwasher safe, and I've washed it a few times with no fading or flaking. I do not know if the top is dishwasher safe, but I don't put it in to keep the steam heat off the rubber seals.I have the Cobalt color, which doesn't match the online photo which looks bolder. In real life mine was a bit paler, not as good looking to be honest. Ultimately, it's just a water bottle and it was a good price so I did not return it just because of the inexact color presentation. But if you only want the Cobalt color pictured then find another color because you won't get that color based on my own experience."

No surprise, I love these Takeya Tritan bottles. They are light weight even when filled, the blue color is beautiful and reminds me of the ocean, they are wide mouthed therefore easy to fill from the water filter. The lid stays out of the way when pushed back, and it's easy to drink from the spout even without a straw. Lid screws down firmly when you're done drinking, so no leaks.

I take it with me running errands, on vacations, hiking, to the beach, pretty much everywhere. I’ve dropped it at least 100 times. To clean it, I just pop it in the dish washer once or twice a week. I chose this one because it’s clear and doesn’t have too many nooks and crannies for dirt or mildew to hide in , so it’s easier to keep clean. It’s held up extremely well over years of heavy use, and the only reason I’m back here to buy a replacement is because I dropped it on the concrete recently and this time it was a hard enough drop to leave a jagged edge on one side of the cap. It’s still usable, but it bugs me enough to warrant getting a new one after over 2.5 years. I never expected it to last that long anyway so I’m happy!"

I actually have the StanleyxStarbucks coffee tumbler for 2 years now before all this Stanley hoopla but haven’t used it yet since I thought it’s only for cold drinks and it’s just 16oz (need at least 20oz coffee in the morning). Anyways, my first time using this at this moment I’m writing this review and I like it. It’s slim, perfect for my short fingers. Love the mouthpiece where I can rest my lips without worrying the area is exposed to any possible dust or dirt and the flip goes all the way to the back without flipping back to your nose. Easy to clean w a bottle brush. Keeps hot for hours  Hopefully this will be better w my many Starbucks coffee tumblers that the flips breaks all the time. I loved my Starbucks coffee tumblers since the inside lining doesn’t scuff after multiple use w hot drinks, doesn’t leak and keeps hot drinks for hours but just the flips keeps on breaking and they're un replaceable. And hopefully the ring inside won’t loosen like my Hydroflask coffee tumbler before. I just wished this comes w Cherry red color. Thank you Amazon for shipping it w a box and a bubble wrap inside. I was skeptical after reading many reviews of them receiving w dents. I’ll give my follow up review if things will turn out opposite from what I expected from this."

It fits into my large cross body bag and doesn’t spill. Keeps water cold for HOURS. It’s solid, not plastic. The only drawback it’s small so you can’t fill with ice from an ice dispenser. Ice cubes are too big so I fill with water from my water pitcher. Looks  good and works. I’m happy with my purchase."

        "title": "Bottle mouth is too small for most average sized ice cubes.",
        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I received my order two days ago, and I am happy with it. The bottle has a sleek design that fits my hand much better than most of the others I’ve owned. I was disappointed by the size of the bottle opening. It is about an inch and a half wide and I will have to buy a smaller bottle brush to clean it properly. I also couldn't get my smaller ice cubes to fit the narrow opening, so I crushed some ice in the blender. The great news is that the ice stayed frozen for at least ten hours. Today, I didn't feel like chopping ice, so I added some very cold water from my fridge to the bottle, and 6 hours later,  it was still cold. If it's possible to redesign this with a wider mouth, it would be perfect for me. However, if you have a crushed ice option on your fridge or an icemaker with small pellet ice, you should have no problems loading it with ice and enjoying a very cold beverage for several hours. Though, so far, the water in the bottle is still cold, even without any ice. I wrote this review so anyone who must have a wide-mouth bottle understands this particular style may not fit your needs. However, if the narrow opening isn't a deal breaker, this is quite a good bottle that delivers on the promise to keep beverages cold for a reasonable price."

I was even surprised how well the wood one looked. For the price and everything it comes with it’s been fantastic. I have had my bottle keep ice water cold for well over 24 hours. I love that I have different lids to choose from. My only real complaint is for the pop/screw top lid. It needs to be tightened extremely well or it will leak. I don’t have to tighten the other lids as much as that one in particular."

If you have smaller hands like my wife you may not like it since she can't drink from it one handed. Part of the reason I purchased this particular bottle was because of the included extra lids, I was hoping they'd fit an Amazon Basics bottle whose lid broke, sadly they do not. I use the flip top lid and compared to the basics lid it's great since it's one handed operation to open and close. The other lids are just taking up space in storage but at least if this one breaks I'll have backups instead of having to buy a whole nother bottle. I've dropped it a few times and the finish seems to have held up great, though upon closer inspection there is a small scratch that I only noticed because I was looking for it. On a solid color it may be more obvious. Wide mouth makes it easy to fill and clean."

        "content": "I purchased the black 64oz bottle and have been using this bottle daily for about two months now. It has great and has met all my expectations. I’m currently living in a tropical climate which means it’s hot and humid all the time. So I needed a large bottle to keep my beverages cold and so I could stay hydrated throughout the day. Since I’ve gotten this bottle I’ve been drinking over a gallon a day.I love that this bottle does not sweat, leaving rings or pools of water behind like non-insulated bottles do. The coating on the bottle looks nice and adds grip which makes holding it easy even when full. This bottle comes with lots of accessories for using and clean adding to the quality and value of this product vs the last one I owned from a different brand.Lids:I love that it comes with multiple caps/lids that are easy to swap out depending on the use. I use the flip straw lid while at school where the bottle sits on my desk and im taking frequent sips. When I’m at home I set it down a lot and so I’m drinking from it less frequently but at greater volume so that’s where the spout lid comes in handy.The paracord handle: It’s a great addition that my previous bottle from a different brand didn’t have and makes carrying it very easy and convenient. Additionally, im apprehensive about carrying the bottle by the lid all the time while it’s full because i can only imagine the nightmare it would be if the lid popped off and the bottle hit the ground causing denting it and then having to deal with half a gallon of fluids all over the floor. Now with that being said I have on occasion held the bottle by the lid and I’ve had no issues.Thermo regulation(hot/cold): I’ve never used it with any hot fluids so unfortunately I can’t share any insight on that. As far as keeping beverages cold I have a little insight. Based on how much I’m drinking I’m refilling this bottle more than once a day. So with that being said testing the limits of how long it keeps beverages cold isn’t something I’m doing. The longest I’ve kept fluid in the bottle is about 12 hours. I filled it up a bit before bed and in the morning it seemed just as cold as when it went in.Potential improvements: Due to the structure, size, and weight when it makes contact with another surface it can be a bit clunky or noisy. This can be resolved with foam/fabric cover or another option I’ve seen is a silicone cap that goes over the bottom of the bottle. Both these options aid in shock absorption and reduces any noise. I know people who have each of these on their bottles and they love them.TLDR: This bottle has lots of great features, it’s a good value and has met or exceeded all my expectations. Based on my experience I’d recommend it to family and friends."

        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "This product is exactly as the description says.  Cold liquids stay cold for about 40hrs-ish.  Hot liquids stay hot for about 14hrs.  The many lid options are also very convenient.  It’s very sturdy and scratch resistant.  I have dropped it a couple times and it’s just fine.  But, it’s a very tall bottle. As you can see in the pic, it’s a little taller than a paper towel roll.  The wide base makes it difficult to put in the sides of bags or cup holders in cars.  It’s also very heavy.  When empty, it’s about 1.12lbs and over 3.5lbs when filled. It’s hard to carry around in the gym or to the park.  For now, I use it when I am working at my desk."

You might want to upgrade your carabiner.The ferro rod shoots monster sparks. Compass works. Whistle works. And paracord seems strong (unsure if 550 or not). If you wanted to buy these things separate, you'd spend more than you did on the bottle. So it's cool you can get them included with a metal insulated jug like this. Very convenient for campouts.No leaks with the straw lid and Spout Lid. Both are more sturdy than my previous ones (stays closed, won't over tighten and skip a thread). And the 64oz lids fit my wide mouth 32oz hydroflasks perfectly.Cheaper to buy a new bottle with 3 lids+accessories instead of just buying a replacement lid set. 10/10 recommend.Keeps that drink COLD. I use this 64oz as a water Buffalo for my easier to carry 32oz. Refill with the pour Spout Lid and enjoy the cold bev. My hydroflask has dents and can't keep anything cold. This 64oz refills ICY cold drinks all day long.Customer service is excellent too. Quick response and great solution. Will be coming back!"

I have an insulated 64oz water bottle but it’s so heavy and bulky I barely take it with me unless I’m going to the gym that day bcuz my other bottles only holds 32oz which finishes before I get through half my day. So I decide atleast a 48oz will do. This one isn’t is too heavy and it’s so fancy and cute with 3 different covers and style. I’m so excited about my water bottle. If I had known it wasn’t going to be heavy, Wish I’d bought the 64oz instead. Gave it a 10. I can’t say if it holds cold and hot water for the amount of hours it states but either way I don’t like my water too cold and it’s not for hot water so it definitely works for me."

I changed to the twist cap spout cover so far, no water shaking in cap."

Not for racing, but on a Sunday rec ride it’s perfect."

So I was SO excited to see that Hydroflask made a water bottle perfect for a bike cage! Fits perfectly in the cage and in your hand. Durable, sturdy, easy to clean, and easy to use.I was worried that not being able to squeeze the bottle would be a big issue. Obviously, it comes out slower because of this but still has a steady enough stream to get enough water in a short amount of time. The push-pull nozzle is a bit stiff to open but easy enough to open with your teeth while riding.As a Hydroflask, this thing does the job of keeping water cold, another bane of typical bike water bottles that get warm quickly. I put in half a cup of ice (just enough to cool the water) and it was still cool 24 hours later. Perfection.A game changer for cyclists!"

It has the typical quality of all Hydro Flasks with a nice powder coated insulated metal body that keeps water cold for days at a time. This has a sport cap top that makes it easy to drink from and a rounded plastic base that makes it a bit more durable when being put down on a surface. The plastic base also seems to stand up to hits better, too. Really good as a bike water bottle due to the size and shape."

        "content": "The Hyrdro Flask 20 ounce Wide Mouth Insulated Sport Bottle is a high quality product with great features. Starting at the bottom - the coating on the lower surface and sides provides a soft surface that is easy to hold without slipping through wet hands and will not scratch whatever you put it down on.The stainless steel interior of the bottle is easy to clean well and I expect it will not hold onto odors of drinks. The wide mouth allows you to put in large ice cubes into the container to keep drinks very cold for an entire day. The sport bottle lid is easy to clean (dishwasher safe), does not leak under normal usage when sealed, and allows you to drink fluid with very little suction when the mouthpiece is pulled open.  So lots of great features here.The air vent in the top has to allow air into the bottle when you drink it because the volume of the container isn’t changing as you drink the liquid. So it will make a little noise as air gets in, that’s just physics principles at work. If you aren’t chugging half a bottle at a time it’s not that loud and really not as big a deal as other reviewers have commented.But I also have to add a few concerns. This bottle is much heavier and costlier than a typical plastic water bottle I would take on a bike ride. Also,  I don’t think the soft outer coating would hold up well in my water bottle cage. In addition, the vent hole does allow liquid to escape when the bottle is shaken. So for these reasons, I wouldn’t take it with me on a bike ride, which is mostly what I use a water bottle for. Still, it’s a great product for taking to the gym, on a hike, or any other activity where it isn’t being shaken too much. For these purposes, I highly recommend this water bottle."

        "content": "This bottle is really nice and well made and I'm really glad it got here in one piece. The only product packaging this bottle has is a small cardboard strip held to the bottle with adhesive, that's great for reducing the bottle's environmental footprint! It's not so great when it's shipped in an unpadded bag and dropped on your porch. Of course that's not the product's fault and when I picked the package up and realized what it was I was fully expecting it to be dented and beat up. To the bottle's credit it doesn't look any worse for wear, no dents or damage I can see.Production quality appears to be top notch. There is a plastic insert in the cap to seal it but otherwise appears to be all stainless steel. The bottle looks great and almost like an old glass pop bottle. The colored half has a light texture too, though it doesn't really seem like it will help with grip much and the bottle is fairly smooth overall. One thing to note is that it does recommend hand washing and the neck being fairly narrow will need to have a bottle brush for it. Time will tell how well it's going to survive everyday use and the inevitable tumbles but it's a really good bottle that's not overly large and high quality."

        "content": "S'well makes really decent water bottles and this one is no exception. The all stainless construction feels solid, with a textured powder coated finish on the upper half that feels as good as it looks. The insulating quality is top-notch. Your cold and hot drinks will maintain temperature for hours... far longer than it would take to finish drinking. At only 17 ounces you'll probably not even need to keep your drink cold for the 36 hours this bottle touts.The bottle itself has a classic tapered shape, with the slight dents on the bottom reminiscent of plastic soda bottles. The neck and mouth opening is slightly larger than a soda bottle's in order to accommodate ice cubes from a dispenser, but it's still so narrow that you'll have to manually insert one ice cube at a time. That also brings up another drawback... hand-washing the inside of the bottle through the smallish opening is a bit difficult. The shape does however make it perfect for fitting into your cup holder. In the age of big Stanley cups with garishly large handles, it's nice to see something so compact and simple. Even if it means you make more trips to refill it, it'll keep you moving and active throughout the day. There are also so many gorgeous color options, you really can't go wrong with any of the choices."

        "title": "Bottle mouth is too small for most average sized ice cubes.",
        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I received my order two days ago, and I am happy with it. The bottle has a sleek design that fits my hand much better than most of the others I’ve owned. I was disappointed by the size of the bottle opening. It is about an inch and a half wide and I will have to buy a smaller bottle brush to clean it properly. I also couldn't get my smaller ice cubes to fit the narrow opening, so I crushed some ice in the blender. The great news is that the ice stayed frozen for at least ten hours. Today, I didn't feel like chopping ice, so I added some very cold water from my fridge to the bottle, and 6 hours later,  it was still cold. If it's possible to redesign this with a wider mouth, it would be perfect for me. However, if you have a crushed ice option on your fridge or an icemaker with small pellet ice, you should have no problems loading it with ice and enjoying a very cold beverage for several hours. Though, so far, the water in the bottle is still cold, even without any ice. I wrote this review so anyone who must have a wide-mouth bottle understands this particular style may not fit your needs. However, if the narrow opening isn't a deal breaker, this is quite a good bottle that delivers on the promise to keep beverages cold for a reasonable price."

I chose the 25 oz. size, but found the finish too slippery to hold, and it was a little difficult to hold onto due to the larger circumference. It felt a little heavy for me to hold as well. Not saying anyone else will have these same issues, but it was my experience. It's a great product, but I think this one is a little bit too big for me. I'll keep it for a backup. Seal works great and doesn't leak. I'm giving it 5 stars as it works great, I just had some difficulty using it that doesn't affect the rating."

If you have smaller hands like my wife you may not like it since she can't drink from it one handed. Part of the reason I purchased this particular bottle was because of the included extra lids, I was hoping they'd fit an Amazon Basics bottle whose lid broke, sadly they do not. I use the flip top lid and compared to the basics lid it's great since it's one handed operation to open and close. The other lids are just taking up space in storage but at least if this one breaks I'll have backups instead of having to buy a whole nother bottle. I've dropped it a few times and the finish seems to have held up great, though upon closer inspection there is a small scratch that I only noticed because I was looking for it. On a solid color it may be more obvious. Wide mouth makes it easy to fill and clean."

        "content": "I purchased the black 64oz bottle and have been using this bottle daily for about two months now. It has great and has met all my expectations. I’m currently living in a tropical climate which means it’s hot and humid all the time. So I needed a large bottle to keep my beverages cold and so I could stay hydrated throughout the day. Since I’ve gotten this bottle I’ve been drinking over a gallon a day.I love that this bottle does not sweat, leaving rings or pools of water behind like non-insulated bottles do. The coating on the bottle looks nice and adds grip which makes holding it easy even when full. This bottle comes with lots of accessories for using and clean adding to the quality and value of this product vs the last one I owned from a different brand.Lids:I love that it comes with multiple caps/lids that are easy to swap out depending on the use. I use the flip straw lid while at school where the bottle sits on my desk and im taking frequent sips. When I’m at home I set it down a lot and so I’m drinking from it less frequently but at greater volume so that’s where the spout lid comes in handy.The paracord handle: It’s a great addition that my previous bottle from a different brand didn’t have and makes carrying it very easy and convenient. Additionally, im apprehensive about carrying the bottle by the lid all the time while it’s full because i can only imagine the nightmare it would be if the lid popped off and the bottle hit the ground causing denting it and then having to deal with half a gallon of fluids all over the floor. Now with that being said I have on occasion held the bottle by the lid and I’ve had no issues.Thermo regulation(hot/cold): I’ve never used it with any hot fluids so unfortunately I can’t share any insight on that. As far as keeping beverages cold I have a little insight. Based on how much I’m drinking I’m refilling this bottle more than once a day. So with that being said testing the limits of how long it keeps beverages cold isn’t something I’m doing. The longest I’ve kept fluid in the bottle is about 12 hours. I filled it up a bit before bed and in the morning it seemed just as cold as when it went in.Potential improvements: Due to the structure, size, and weight when it makes contact with another surface it can be a bit clunky or noisy. This can be resolved with foam/fabric cover or another option I’ve seen is a silicone cap that goes over the bottom of the bottle. Both these options aid in shock absorption and reduces any noise. I know people who have each of these on their bottles and they love them.TLDR: This bottle has lots of great features, it’s a good value and has met or exceeded all my expectations. Based on my experience I’d recommend it to family and friends."

The many lid options are also very convenient.  It’s very sturdy and scratch resistant.  I have dropped it a couple times and it’s just fine.  But, it’s a very tall bottle. As you can see in the pic, it’s a little taller than a paper towel roll.  The wide base makes it difficult to put in the sides of bags or cup holders in cars.  It’s also very heavy.  When empty, it’s about 1.12lbs and over 3.5lbs when filled. It’s hard to carry around in the gym or to the park.  For now, I use it when I am working at my desk."

Very convenient for campouts.No leaks with the straw lid and Spout Lid. Both are more sturdy than my previous ones (stays closed, won't over tighten and skip a thread). And the 64oz lids fit my wide mouth 32oz hydroflasks perfectly.Cheaper to buy a new bottle with 3 lids+accessories instead of just buying a replacement lid set. 10/10 recommend.Keeps that drink COLD. I use this 64oz as a water Buffalo for my easier to carry 32oz. Refill with the pour Spout Lid and enjoy the cold bev. My hydroflask has dents and can't keep anything cold.

It holds the perfect amount of water to quench my thirst on a  hot summer's day.  The flip-top cap makes it easy to quickly  get a drink - no need to twist off the cap.  It is water-tight, so I don't have to worry about any leaks on my paperwork if it gets tipped over.  Plus, it will survive being dropped onto hard surfaces like a sidewalk.  It fits the cupholders in my car, and I can even rest my arm on it as I drive.  Lastly, at the end of the day, I can toss this water bottle in the dishwasher. I have tried them all, and this water bottle is, by far, the best designed one I have ever used.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could."

I can easily fill it with ice from the ice machine at work, as the mouth of the bottle is large enough. The flip cap locks in place well and the bottle does not leak at all. This is exactly what I wanted as I drink 45-60 ounces of water per day.  I love that there is a plastic loop on it. I can clip it to my duty belt so I remember to bring it to work and do not leave it behind. the only drawback is it does not fit in my waterbottle holder on my mountain bike. Aside from that,  I highly recommend this bottle."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "The Criterion 2-disc Bottle Rocket is outstanding, but don't toss your original disc just yet... the new edition is a slightly different edit that loses one laugh and adds another. I couldn't find any reference to these changes in the supplementary material at all.MISSING: Originally, during the book store robbery, Anthony grabs a random book off the shelf and opens it, revealing the title page \"Job Opportunities in Government - 1995\" which always gave me a little chuckle. Now for some reason the book opens to a black and white  photograph of a military plane (it goes by so fast you'd have to freeze frame to make it out.) ** UPDATE *** per the new Wes Anderson coffee table book, we learn that the military plane shot was in the original cut ( a bit of non-sequitor humor... you think Anthony is reading something important enough to distract him from the business of robbing the store, only to discover its a completely off-topic, random photograph.) The studio wanted a more obvious laugh so they had Wes reshoot the \"Job Opportunities...\" title page (which, if you look closely, was just taped into the book). This Criterion edition restores the original shot.\n  \nThe Wes Anderson Collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    ADDED: Originally, when Bob hands his earnings over to Future Man to cover his attorney fees, he asks if he can keep a few bucks for gas, and the scene ends. Now the scene plays a few seconds longer, and we hear Future Man's reply: \"No, you can't.\"In addition to these minor (and somewhat baffling) changes, I was also  unable to find any images of the one-sheet art or logo anywhere on this set (as appears on the menu page and sleeve of the original release).So if you're a hardcore Bottle Rocket fan or completist, hang onto your old disc and buy this set as well. In addition to a beautiful transfer, commentary track, documentary, the original short film, and other extras, the booklet insert is a miniature replica of Dignan's 75-Year Plan notebook, along with reproductions of Anthony's drawing of Inez on horseback, the book store heist plan schematics, etc."

As for the film, at the very least i find it fun and usually worth it to go back and check out a talented filmmaker's earlier work. The plot is all but entirely absent along with all the character's motivation for their actions. That is not necessarily make a film bad, just a bit hard to track or place. I was entertained for the most part, although the story did meander in the middle act and ultimately nothing is answered or understood. It is cool to see the framework of what would eventually be a \"Wes Anderson film\" and as long as you can tolerate non stop Wilson (both) energy then this lesser known early film is a taste of what will come"

This is a very early Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson film about a trio of young guys all with different personalities and ambitions trying to make a hustle that they're not quite qualified for. Its pretty much an all guy movie, you can count the females on one hand, but its a very human movie and the dialog is great. And there's a bit of surprise at the end. I will definitely watch this one more than once."
