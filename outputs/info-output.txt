        "content": "I needed a new desktop and was weighing between this Acer and a Lenovo. The Lenovo had the disk drive I wanted, but I went with the Acer because I've had such good luck with them in the past. What a mistake! The day before the free return expired the mouse stopped working. I tried using the form on the Acer website, but it refused to recognize the serial numbers on the back of the computer. There are only two numbers, I tried each one three times and neither was recognized. This isn't rocket science. So, I found an email address, sent them a message. 72 hours later they responded, asking for those numbers. By this time my new mouse had arrived, and I was able to double check that all drivers were up to date. They were. The new mouse worked four hours and then it also stopped working. I let the computer sit for 3 days, working on my backup computer, turned this one back on, and it worked. For 10 days. Now it won't go online. At all. I'm going to have to do my best to get as much work as possible off of the computer onto an external hard drive and then return the thing to factory settings. And then I'll put it back in the box and donate it to charity. I can't stand it anymore. Don't make my mistake. Try a different brand."

(i have all the proofI have had to return it, and i was charged 120$ for that.In addition to that, i have spent about 20 hours of my time in order to first copy all my files and setting up my accounts, and then remove from the machine for the return.Last time I'm buying a Dell, and Last time I'm buying computers on Amazon.They should be paying me for their disservice."

The fan runs constantly and loudly the camera fades in and out and the keyboard and mouse will not connect. I purchased another Acer because the prior PC I had was an Acer and it served me well for 10 years but this one is a bunch of crap it seems. I’m so frustrated."

        "content": "Full disclosure: I regularly use and prefer the IOS operating system because I don’t ever recall experiencing unexplainable crashes and unprovoked system restarts, and, most importantly, I don’t need to purchase anti-virus software. With that said, I did, however, need a Window’s base system to use a MS graphic designer used for desktop publishing that I really liked; the reason I ordered this Acer Aspire desktop.Minus the lengthy software set up process and the nonobservance of my selection to set up this computer as new, yet the software moved files from my existing MS account to this Acer Aspire’s desktop, I was pleased with the speed of this desktop, especially while searching the internet. The colors on the screen were vibrant and the images on the screen were crystal clear. McAfee anti-virus’ software was already installed, and I think there was a 90-trial period, but I was able to easily uninstall and install an alternative anti-virus program that I favored. I appreciated that the 21.5” screen easily tilted to preference and the size of the screen made viewing content on the screen comfortable for my eyes, without having to change the settings.The Acer Aspire’s companion keyboard and mouse operated well and were of decent quality, and all I had to do was to plug each device into the back ports, power on the system, and the software walked me through set-up. I can’t comment on this desktop’s gaming potential because I’ll only be using the computer for desktop publishing. So far, I haven’t had any problems designing marketing materials on this unit."

The original keyboard and mouse had to be replaced during the first month of use, with aftermarket units, due to very poor construction. Pathetic quality and very poor construction.Honestly I cannot recommend this computer under any situation. A computer that will not recognize external HD's - memory cards or any form of external storage is of no use at all. Avoid this product at all costs. I've only had it since December 2023 and I'm already having to replace the entire piece of garbage."
