        "content": "I particularly liked the medium size of the bottles. I didn't want insulated bottles that just added weight to our backpacks. I can deal with warm water. These bottles have a good capacity and still fit comfortably in our backpacks bottle pockets. I listen to the comments from those who said to make sure to lock the tops after closing. We haven't had any problems with leaking. Our bottle brush will fit inside to give them a good cleaning. The only disadvantage I found is some odor, sort of plasticy."

It’s super portable and I can hang it almost anywhere! 10/10 highly recommend!"

        "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "One of the main reasons I purchased these bottles was because Amazon backed them with a one-year warranty. They carry the Amazon Brand and specifically state they have a year warranty.Fast forward 4 months and the lid breaks making the bottle unusable. No problem right? There’s even a link to product support. But wait, the link takes you a BROKEN link - nothing there. So I call Amazon customer service (basically out of I’m just upset at the dishonesty of it all) and they put me on hold, ask me if I’ll take a $5 credit, put me on hold, they argue that it doesn’t say 1 year warranty (yep, it’s there currently on your website).Word of device. DONT TRUST AMAZON BASICS WARRANTY.It’s a cheap bottle, they don’t stand behind their product. Buy a better brand."

        "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I don’t understand why the lid screws off the way it does, because the mouth of the bottle does not get wider (easier to clean), although I do appreciate that there are no small parts.Also, it varies how much force you need to put on the lid to close it which is annoying.Overall a solid bottle, I’ve dropped it a few times and it hasn’t broken but I am missing that satisfying click to close, and it advertises as easy to clean but it could be easier."

        "content": "We like this water bottle for its convenience.  It is well-made and has stood up to a bit of bashing around without any problems.  The only drawback is that the lid opens by pressing a bar at the front of the lid.  If anything touches that spot, the lid opens up and water spills out.  Learned that the hard way!  However, there is a locking slide that prevents that, though I had a tiny amount of water spill out when I knocked it over with the lid locked.  For cleaning, I put it in the top shelf of my dishwasher."

But now, 2 months after I got them, the lids of both bottles I bought are falling apart, and in different ways! Also, the body of the bottle scratches very easily. My 2 month old bottle looks 2 years old. Very poorly made."
