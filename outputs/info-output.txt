This is THE ONE. I should have got this sooner/first.I can't imagine a better bottle than this in terms of replicating a real nipple (I easily notice the higher quality in the material), ease of cleaning, and how attractive the bottle looks (the blue is so beautiful!!) -- and of course, a highly reputable well established brand.I was worried at first about the different nipple sizes. The default one that comes with this is \"Flow 3\" which is the middle level, targeted for 1 month old.My baby gobbles up milk like a starving child every time; this nipple works fine for him.He can finish the 4 oz milk less than 10 minutes, which is good. If it takes longer than 30 minutes to feed your baby, that's not right, and exhausting for the parent too.It doesn't make weird sounds when he's drinking and and it doesn't drip. There's no milk wasted either. So much better than the lame Dr. brand I was using before; that one also had so many parts to clean, it was more work.The top cap has a thumb grip area, which can still be a little difficult to open if it's wet. I also notice the silicone has a bit of certain odor when you get it.Philips AVENT is easily one of the best baby bottles on the market. It's the perfect gift - must have for any parents out there.It's life changing. It will make feeding time more convenient and a pleasure for you. It's worth spending extra considering you're going to be feeding your baby so many times. It was definitely worth the investment."

These were the only bottles that we could get him to take even for a few minutes. My other child likes to have bottles at night and she absolutely loves these. They are one of our favorites, they’re easy to clean they don’t leak and the kids really like them. It’s easy to get replacement parts or upgrade nipples should you need."

        "content": "These came with a flow 3 which is a tad too fast for my enthusiastic 2 month old boy, especially when he gets extra fussy and acts like he hasn't eaten all day. So I had to switch to a flow 2 buy I think soon I'll switch back to the 3. I love the natural nipple and how it doesn't leak. We had the Tomme tippe flow 0 bottles and the flow was still too fast that it would come out the side of his mouth. Since switching to these, we haven't had that problem."

        "content": "These bottles are amazing. I had used so many different ones. The mam, dr browns, chicco duo, parents choice wide neck, pigeon, avent anti colic, and my baby did not take well to them. For about 3-4 months we used the chicco duo and those were a favorite until I found these. They are easy to clean and the valve on the nipple for air works so amazing. My baby has very little air going into his tummy and he drinks the bottle without collapsing the nipple. He is 5 months but he loves to chug down so the sizing for these nipples is amazing. Size 3 is perfect for him since he can control it and I noticed he does not take as many breaks drinking, he just keeps drinking and maybe takes 2-3 breaks and then he keeps going usually he would collapse the chicco duo nipple even if I moved him to size 2 nipple. But I found these my savings grace and I am so happy. They are affordable in my opinion compared to other bottles that claim to do the same thing these do and they don’t. Anyway love these."

        "content": "These bottles have been great for our breastfed baby. He took to this bottle right away as a newborn and goes between breast and bottle feeding with no issue. I also love that the bottles are simple and don’t have too many parts. The nipple has a slow flow so you may have to try a few sizes to see which size works best for your baby. These bottles also are compatible with the Motif Luna and Spectra pump flanges which is super helpful if you want to feed baby freshly pumped milk."

They are so nice because they are wide which makes it so much easier to fill. We use breast milk and supplement with formula so pouring from bags as well as putting in scoops of powdered formula is so much easier and you don't waste it by spilling it trying to get it into a standard size bottle neck. Another giant advantage for me is being able to actually read the numbers to measure.  The light blue is a nice faint shade, they are easy to hold and see how much milk is actually in the nipple so they don't get a bunch of air, which helps on too much gas. The nipples it comes with have a good shape that is more natural and soft against his face. He actually likes these best. They are also easier to clean and sturdy enough to last for years through multiple babies and the nipples can be replaced very easy as needed. They are a really good quality which makes the price worth it. I'm very happy with them I highly recommend these and I hope this info helps you."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "If your baby will accept this nipple for feeding, stay the course and stick with these bottles. They are seriously no fuss and work as they are intended to with NO LEAKS, minimal and easy to clean parts, and the bottle vents perfectly as long as the nipple is lined up with the notch. These bottles have a great design to hold a lot of ounces without looking and feeling huge like other brands. Additionally, leakage is a huge problem with other popular brands that I just could not deal with anymore. Most other bottles made my baby fuss and make feedings a sloppy mess. These nipples help the baby to pace their feeding out on their terms and then the milk stops from rolling out of their mouth. It took about a day or two for my baby to get the hang of the nipple but it was totally worth it. Additionally, pay close attention to the flow chart to figure out which nipple will work best for your baby. These bottles saved my sanity!"

So, we ended up buying Avent again. These bottles are perfect in shape, neither too small nor too big. Perfect for those growing little fingers to hold. Nipples are also very good and our little one got used to it very quickly. These bottles are a great deal!!"

        "content": "Used the 4oz size since birth. She just started drinking 6-8oz per feed so got larger size and she can still hold this one just fine. Prevents me from having to get up mid nap to refill bottle or make two at once.Glass one was better for breast milk because fat did not get stuck on the sides. Plastic is better for baby holding due to weight although she can hold both."
