      "Hi. We make water bottles.",
      "Why? Well, we’re a motley crew of dreamers and designers who live by a simple creed: “Do more of what you love.”​",
      "And we love designing things that make life a little bit easier and a heckuva a lot more enjoyable. We asked ourselves, with so many different kinds of water bottles out there, why do 3 out of 4 people still suffer from chronic dehydration?",
      "So we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. We created what we believe to be the finest water bottles in all the land. Water bottles designed to help you do more of what you love. So, what are you waiting for? Go forth and carpe the diem—hydrated like a boss.",

      "FreeSip Spout",
      "What makes the Owala FreeSip so different than other bottles? The FreeSip has a patented 2-in-1 spout that rocks BOTH a built-in straw for sipping AND a wide-mouth opening for chugging. That’s right—two different ways to drink.",

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I’ve been using reusable water bottles for over two decades. The Owala free sip is leaps and bounds better than any water bottle I’ve ever used. I will never buy another brand! The first one I bought was probably 3 years ago. It still works just as well now as it did the day I bought it. I’ve dropped it more times than I can count and never broken. I finally decided to broaden my horizons and purchase different colors. I will tell anyone who asks about the quality of these bottles. There’s something strangely satisfying about drinking from this bottle. The spout is shaped in a way that isn’t overwhelming sensory wise as it seems to be designed to fit the mouth. I always avoided cups with straws in the past because of the potential for bacterial growth and exposure. The design of these cups makes it easy to clean. My drinks stay cold for a long period of time.I promise, you won’t regret buying this!Side note, they say drinking out of the bottle makes you look like a koala, which is a great added bonus."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "In person the colors are every bit as vibrant as the image online (color I have is Summer Sweetness) and the bottle works great both at my desk during work hours or in the gym. Really appreciate the push button opening to prevent leaks and the carry loop makes it easy to carry when my hands are full. Have definitely found myself drinking more water at work because it stays cool and the straw makes sipping so easy! I have not tested how long it keeps things cool but haven't had any concerns about the water getting tepid."

        "title": "Beautiful AND leakproof when closed",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I saw the good reviews and gave this a try, and I LOVE it!  Not only is it beautiful, with its gorgeous interplay of vivid colors, but it WORKS.  To be honest, I wasn't sure how it could have an \"attached straw,\" but as soon as I tried to take a sip, I realized that it works.  It works beautifully.  The color combination I wanted came in a smaller form, so I usually have to refill it halfway through the day, but this water bottle makes taking a sip so easy and so carefree - the best quality (to me) is that when it's closed, this doesn't leak AT ALL.  With the lock mechanism so easy to use, the pop-up top is easy to open and close, and that makes this my most carefree water bottle.  I've started bringing it with me everywhere.  (Oh, and it fits into my car's cup holder, which I cannot say for the \"Stanley Cup\" knockoff.)  Such a great bottle - I'm probably going to buy a few more.  Try one for yourself and see if you don't agree!  Easy to hold, easy to carry, easy to use, and pretty!"

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "Love this water bottle. It’s good quality, &rivals other name brands. Priced a good $8-10 cheaper than more well known brands too. I read an article online praising this & ordered it as a result. Needless to say, I’m very pleased. It keeps cold beverages cold & there is no lead used in construction of this. I love the snap shut leak proof feature as well. It’s a tall & slender water bottle. The only thing I am not pleased with  is that it isn’t for hot beverages, only cold. There is a built in straw & you can drink from it using the straw or tip it back to drink."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "Yes, this bottle prevents leaks and spills. Yes, this bottle keeps beverages cold. Yes, it has a great carrying handle and complimentary colors. But what really stands out about this one is how great it is to drink from. When I was a teacher, I had students who called their water bottle their comfort blanket. Never understood it until now. I don't like drinking out of a straw, but the opening for the straw is so perfect and convenient, I use it over the large opening. I'm drinking 3 bottles (32 oz bottle) a day now, way more than I ever have before. The water somehow tastes better (maybe how cold it is?) too making me more likely to drink. I've had other water bottles. Hated them all. But I LOVE this one and bring it everywhere"

        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I have been on a mission to find the very best water bottle.  I had settled on a glass bottle with a flip top cap, see through design, leak-proof, easy sip,  and handsome exterior.  But then I saw the Owala Bottle in a store.. First, the Owala's have a wonderful palate of colors, and handsome design.  I love the size and look of the sipping part of the bottle......just the right amount of water.  But what makes the Owala my new favorite is the stainless steel that makes the water taste wonderful, chilled all through the day.  .not too cold, just right.  What I do is set up the bottle in open mode, and sip from it throughout the day.  Because of all these factors, I have been drinking more water.  Even though the cap is open, the water remains chilled.  I have two Owala bottles, and will order two more.  The reason for 4 stars?  The flip lids on my bottles don't work, so I just manually flip them open.....Perhaps they will loosen over time."

        "title": "Fun, durable, functional, and no funky tasting water!",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "When I was pregnant with my second daughter I was surprised when my doctor advised me to not drink from plastic or cook with non-stick.  I did some research and we made changes, including converting to stainless steel water bottles.  It has been so hard to find a good water bottle that is all stainless steel and doesn’t leak.  Klean Kanteen is decent, but the silicone inserts that seal the lid break down over time and literally shred apart.  If I’m paying a premium price, I don’t want a water bottle with a short lifespan.  ThermoFlask is another decent option, but we’ve had the same issue with the lid seal breaking down, and also the straws seem to wear out.  They get sort of scuffed up and discolored, and by the end of the day the water starts to have a funny plastic taste.  Makes me wonder what the heck I’m marinating in my water all day.  So we decided to give Owala a try, and for us, these are the best option we’ve found so far.  The bottle itself is insulated stainless steel, and only the lid and straw are plastic.  But they seem to be “better” plastic = super hard and durable plastic, including the straw which is rigid and does not bend (ThermoFlask plastic straws bend).  Maybe this type of plastic is more resistant to wear and tear, I’m not sure, all I know is that we can leave water in the bottles for DAYS and it still tastes just like water, no funky flavors.  I can stick all parts in the dishwasher over and over again, including the straw, and they come out clean and looking brand new every time, without stains.  The silicone insert that seals the lid seems to be better designed and more resistant to breaking down than Klean Kanteen and Thermoflask.  My girls love all the different fun color options, it’s nice to be able to chug if you are super thirsty, or keep the bottle upright to take a sip from the straw.  Especially for our youngest, the straw feature is essential.  And the bottles can take a beating, we’ve dropped them on sidewalks, hardwood floors, concrete, etc and they are still going strong.  A note on sizing, the 24 oz and 32 oz sizes are actually the exact same height, it’s just the 24oz is a little thinner.  I’ve included side-by-side photos.  There really is not much physical difference between these two capacities, so we bumped up to the 32 oz for my daughter who is in first grade, since she was running out of water by the end of the school day with the 24 oz.  The 32 oz still easily fits in the side pocket of her backpack, and it’s enough water for her to get through the day.  Bottom line - these water bottles are durable, they function great, and they keep our water cold and fresh and free of funky flavors.  Until someone cracks the code for a durable, 100% all stainless-steel water bottle with a straw that doesn’t leak, these are the go-to in our household.  Highly recommend."
