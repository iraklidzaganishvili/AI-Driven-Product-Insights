        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "It's a quality item for a great price; kept my drinks hot. I chose the 25 oz. size, but found the finish too slippery to hold, and it was a little difficult to hold onto due to the larger circumference. It felt a little heavy for me to hold as well. Not saying anyone else will have these same issues, but it was my experience. It's a great product, but I think this one is a little bit too big for me. I'll keep it for a backup. Seal works great and doesn't leak. I'm giving it 5 stars as it works great, I just had some difficulty using it that doesn't affect the rating."

        "title": "Bottle mouth is too small for most average sized ice cubes.",
        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I received my order two days ago, and I am happy with it. The bottle has a sleek design that fits my hand much better than most of the others I’ve owned. I was disappointed by the size of the bottle opening. It is about an inch and a half wide and I will have to buy a smaller bottle brush to clean it properly. I also couldn't get my smaller ice cubes to fit the narrow opening, so I crushed some ice in the blender. The great news is that the ice stayed frozen for at least ten hours. Today, I didn't feel like chopping ice, so I added some very cold water from my fridge to the bottle, and 6 hours later,  it was still cold. If it's possible to redesign this with a wider mouth, it would be perfect for me. However, if you have a crushed ice option on your fridge or an icemaker with small pellet ice, you should have no problems loading it with ice and enjoying a very cold beverage for several hours. Though, so far, the water in the bottle is still cold, even without any ice. I wrote this review so anyone who must have a wide-mouth bottle understands this particular style may not fit your needs. However, if the narrow opening isn't a deal breaker, this is quite a good bottle that delivers on the promise to keep beverages cold for a reasonable price."

I have a very nice stainless steel bottle that is similar that I bought for $3 at Ross that has the features mentioned.  It is not insulated though.  I will see how well my water stays cold with the one I just purchased.  It's ok for the price, but I would pay a few dollars more for the features mentioned above."
