        "content": "Purchased this water bottle for my daughter to replace her old hydroflask due to regular wear and several drops/dents. Her old one began to leak from being dropped so many times, but still kept her beverages very cold. We purchased the new one and the new size/shape is perfect. The straw/sipper is updated so it totally comes apart to be washed. I was very happy with this new update. You can either attach the straw to suck on the top or you can detach the straw to tip it back and let the water flow out. Nice that their is an option. Color is beautiful and bottle has the quality I have come to expect from hydroflask."

This one has double wall vacuum insulation which keeps the temperature good and I would try to drink at least a bottle of this per day. If I go to gym and exercise I would drink more. It is leak proof, and the straw cap at the top makes it easy to sip."

Love how easy this is to add water and ice, it doesn’t leak, and the straw makes it easy to drink water one-handed and in the car. A little pricier than other water bottles but in my opinion, highly worth it! Also the color options are awesome and I love my grey-green color."

        "content": "This is truly what I wanted for trips to the beach, travel and other activities where hydration (or your fav adult bev) is desired.  Thermal quality, fit and finish are excellent.  The wide mouth accepts whole ice cubes and makes filling and washing easy. The lid includes a well designed finger hold and the flip mechanism for the straw, which seals perfectly.  When ordering, I was a little concerned about the large size, but in use, it is perfect.  I also purchased the small \"boot\" for the flask bottom, which adds a stylish/finished look and quiets it down while rolling around in my vehicle.  I'm totally sold."

        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "The Hydro Flask Stainless Steel Wide Mouth Water Bottle with Flex Straw Lid has proven to be a game-changer in the world of hydration. As an avid water bottle user, I was skeptical about whether it could truly live up to the hype surrounding it. However, after using it consistently, I am thoroughly impressed.One of the standout features is the build quality. The stainless steel construction not only gives the bottle a sleek and modern appearance but also ensures durability and longevity. The wide mouth design makes it easy to fill, clean, and even add ice cubes for that extra chill. The powder-coated finish not only adds a touch of style but also provides a non-slip grip, preventing accidental drops.The Flex Straw Lid is a game-changer for those who prefer sipping over the traditional screw-on cap. The flexible straw is made from high-quality silicone, providing a comfortable and drip-free drinking experience. The lid's durability is commendable, and the simplicity of its design makes it easy to disassemble and clean thoroughly.Temperature retention is another area where the Hydro Flask shines. Whether I'm enjoying a hot coffee on a chilly morning or sipping ice-cold water during a workout, the bottle consistently maintains the desired temperature for an extended period. The double-wall vacuum insulation truly lives up to its promises.What sets this water bottle apart is its commitment to environmental sustainability. By investing in a Hydro Flask, users are contributing to the reduction of single-use plastic waste. The reusable nature of the bottle is a small yet impactful step towards a greener planet.The only minor drawback is the weight of the stainless steel, making the bottle slightly heavier than its plastic counterparts. However, the trade-off for durability and insulation capabilities is well worth it.In conclusion, the Hydro Flask Stainless Steel Wide Mouth Water Bottle with Flex Straw Lid is a top-tier choice for anyone seeking a reliable, durable, and stylish hydration companion. Its thoughtful design, excellent build quality, and commitment to sustainability make it a standout product in the crowded water bottle market. Highly recommended!"

        "content": "There are a gazillion water bottle choices out there and Hydro Flask seems to have a very loyal following.  My husband has had them for years.  I've always opted for less expensive brands and have found that my bottles often out perform his as far as keeping ice for long periods of time.  And he has lost the rubber gasket in the lids of his Hydro Flasks and has on occasion had major leakage issues because of it.  One learns that the gasket is gone the hard way, as you end up with water, or coffee or tea all over the place, hopefully not in  your lap!When I saw a Cyber Monday deal for Hydro Flasks here on Amazon, I decided to take this opportunity to try one out for myself.  I got the purple one and the color is SO PRETTY.  I do like the colors that Hydro Flask offers...so that's a plus.I don't have any major complaints about this bottle except for the lid.  If I put my powdered drink mix into the bottle with water and shake it, the seal does seem to hold and stays dry (right now anyway).  But when the top is opened to take a drink, liquid shoots out of the top.  Pressure has built up inside the bottle.  I guess it's not a deal breaker, but depending on what you have in your bottle, this could be a very bad thing.Also, I have found that when I take a drink through the extended flip-up piece on the lid, liquid shoots up out of it when  I'm done.  I can't be the only person on the planet that this has happened to.  It is a design flaw in the way the lid handles the pressure inside the bottle as one drinks.  Again...not a deal breaker, but I get sick of having water shoot up onto my face after I drink.  I have found a way to deal with this by placing my tongue on the opening of the raised straw, but one shouldn't have to think that hard when they take a drink of water from a bottle.  My other water bottle of a lesser known brand doesn't do this.The Hydro Flask has a slightly rough surface on the outside which makes the bottle easier to hold than if it was slick and smooth, but I ended up getting an outer sleeve made of silicone so that I'm less likely to drop the bottle.  I have a friend who once dropped her Hydro Flask and it looks like it's been through a war...so they are not that tough on the outside.As far as keeping ice over a period of time, the Hydro Flask pales in comparison to some other brands.  Corcksicicle brand holds ice FOREVER...I mean for DAYS!...and my Simple Modern brand 40 oz bottle outdoes the Hydro Flask by a landslide when it comes to keeping ice.  I know this because I recently traveled with my Simple Modern while my friend  and travel buddy had her Hydro Flask.  Each morning we filled our bottles with about the same amount of ice.  Her Hydro Flask ice was gone many hours before my Simple Modern ice was, so this was a side by side comparison.  Of course the Simple Modern bottle was purchased at a fraction of the price of a Hydro Flask.All in all I'm happy to have a Hydro Flask, but I'm VERY glad that I didn't pay even close to full price for it.  They simply are not worth the hefty price tag from a performance standpoint.  The fact that you can get replacement parts for them (lids, straws and rubber gaskets) does make the investment more appealing."

That was almost a year ago and she has used it and still does on a daily for school and for all of her after school sports practices and games. She's not one to be gentle with her stuff and this gets tossed aside and around at just about every practice so I can't imagine what happens at school with it being in her bag. This jug has proven to be extremely durable and hasn't sprung a leak yet! I am considering ordering one for my other two kids since this jug has survived my roughest/toughest child!"
