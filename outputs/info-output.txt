        "content": "I used to buy bottled water, but now that my State's bottle return went up to 10 cents, I refuse to buy them anymore. So I bought this bottle, and it is so much better than any bottled water because it stays cold! It's the perfect size because it fits right in my pocketbook, which is convenient if my hands are full. And thankfully it does not leak! But it doesn't fit in my cup holder in my car, so that's my only complaint. The handle that it comes with is not going to fit your wrist. So you can really only stick your fingers through the loop and hold it that way. Which is fine with me."

        "content": "I have two plans for this bottle. One is to replace the plastic water bottle I keep at my bedside and the other is for travel. I wanted a bottle with a top that screws on like a plastic water bottle because in my experience, that is easier to close than when the top screws inside. For traveling, having a hand strap should make it easier to keep hold of it. I also did NOT want a straw. While a bottle with a straw is great for active situations, I don't like taking pills with a straw. I was impressed with the leak proof performance when I had partially closed it late at night and it slipped out of my hand and fell, but didn't leak. It is also insulated, keeping the water cold all night. The only challenge is that on my uninsulated metal water bottles, I can guess the fill level from my refrigerator spout by the location of the cooler part of the bottle. This one got overfilled the first time I used it because there is no temperature differential on the outside during filling."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "Super cute, but we're returning.  It was too shiny glittery for my daughter.  It sure is FABULOUS if you like the shimmer & shine. Not sure about anything else as we didn't use, but looks of very good quality!"

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "My old bottle was incredibly banged up and it's such a relief to have this replacement. I tote it around with me everywhere, and it's a great size for that (just barely fits in my purse and doesn't leak) and keeps my water cold for a while, which my old bottle didn't do. Despite my best efforts, I've already dropped it on gravel once in the few weeks since I got it, which chipped the paint and only barely dented the metal, so hopefully this is sturdier than my other bottle, too. I like the twist cap style as opposed to a straw or anything else because this style is easier to clean. My one gripe is that the cap can be difficult to twist off when it's slippery, because it has no ridges to grip."
