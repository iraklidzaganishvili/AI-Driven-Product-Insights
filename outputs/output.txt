        "content": "This water bottle is so unique like no other. Aside from keeping my drink cold for a long time, aside from the very colorful top that attracted me foremost ever since the first time I laid my eyes on it,  I love so much the sip and swig features - big spout opening and the unique sip hole that looks like a contour of a pursed lip. The big straw inside that is connected to it gives me the right size amount of drink, water in this case, when I have to take in a sip to drink some medication. Proven for its quality, last night, I placed a couple of lemon slices to my water inside and let it seep through overnight. This morning, when I took a sip, some of the lemon parts got stuck at the bottom end of the straw, preventing me to drink a good amount of my usual sip. It was no problem at all. That’s where the swig features comes in handy. I tilted my head and got a good gulp amount of water. Boy I just love this Owala. I love parading it at work, swinging and swaying it around with the easy lift and secure handle. No spill at all. 32 oz is the most perfect size for me. (Oh my, first time a wrote a long review. Sorry, can’t control myself, I just love this Owala)"

Turns out the design is very well thought out, comes with a straw but also allows u to drink from it without the straw if you prefer (it's also satisfying because you always get that last drop of water out). The bottle is easy to grab even for people with smaller hands. Keeps the temperature of the water the same as when it was put in. The bottle fits into the side pouch of most backpacks, including my own which is a pretty tight fit. Only drawback is that it's a bit heavy but that's to be expected for a metal bottle filled with water."

The FreeSip lid allows me to drink from the bottle without having to tilt my head back, which is great for when I'm driving or working at my desk. The lid is also leak-proof, so I don't have to worry about any spills. The bottle itself is made of durable stainless steel and keeps my water cold for hours. I also appreciate that the bottle is BPA-free and environmentally friendly. Overall, I highly recommend the Owala FreeSip water bottle to anyone in the market for a high-quality, functional water bottle."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "This is an easy one-handed push button to access the drinking area. I feel this keeps it sanitary. It has a straw that can detach to be cleaned. This allows you to sip to the straw or tilt the container up to drink. They do say not to use hot liquids for safety reasons. Pressure can build up. I haven't used it long-term, so I cannot comment on staining or ease of cleaning. It will mostly be used for water. It is keeping the water very cold for a long time. The only downside is that you have to close it for best performance on keeping liquids cold and not spilling if it gets knocked over-- I do tend to tip my water bottle over in the car or at the gym. Having to push the button every time is kind of inconvenient and I wonder about the longevity. However, everything else combined makes this a good choice."

        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "After years of owning Yeti bottles, I switched to this bottle mostly because my daughter told me about it.  What I found is that it’s the best designed of all the ones out there.We briefly tried the Stanley bottles with built in handles and straws. While those are good, I found carrying those around to be awkward, especially if I want to store them in a backpack.Enter Owala.  I own three sizes for different reasons. The 40oz is the one I use daily at home. It either sits next to the bed overnight or I use it for my work day.  The bottle keeps water cold for up to 48 hours.I also carry a 32oz for daily excursions. The 40oz is just too big for cup holders. The 32oz also keeps cold for up to two days. Finally, I have a 24oz that I use for travel.I love the spout.  The bottle allows me to drink however I feel necessary. Normally I use the built in straw, but there are times I’ve just wanted to chug water and their spout allows me to do both.The cap seals extremely well. We’ve had Yeti bottles leak, Owala seems to have solved this issue quite well.Now for the bad things…. If you fill the bottle with ice water, I suggest adding the ice last.  Putting ice in first causes it to stay in the lower section of the bottle, making it hard to get the straw into it. I usually fill my bottle with water, add ice and then push the straw through.Second, I had the flip top mechanism stick a bit on one bottle, which I promptly returned and replaced. Only happened on one out of the five we own in the house.Overall this is a highly recommended item that you will not regret."

        "title": "Best water bottle ever",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I have spent so much money on cheaper water bottles that don't work.  Especially straw types.  This straw is completely different.  It's \"mouth shaped\" at the top and SECURELY attached inside so it doesn't pop off like the cheap ones do.  It's also straight instead of curved so I get water all the way down to the bottom.  There is also a chug hole.  My only advice is don't forget it's there and tilt the bottle up to drink from the straw.  I did that once.  Whoops.  But the chug hole is a great feature too!  At dance classes I need more than a sip.  That being said -- the straw hole delivers a solid stream of water with minimal effort.  I did drop it and scraped some of the paint off yesterday, but all things considered, it was a hard drop and it barely dented.  I'd say it's pretty sturdy!  It is also attractive, sporting bright colors that make me smile when I look at it.  Honestly, I wish I had sprung for the $30 bucks a LOT sooner because I'm so happy with this water bottle.  I'd have to LOSE it to make me buy another one, which isn't so great for the company, but it's hard to need to replace perfection.  This is the perfect water bottle for me.  Oh -- and it doesn't leak when the lid is shut.  I was worried because I have an apple tag hooked to the locking portion, so I was afraid it would leak, but it does not.  If you aren't using the lock as a handle like I am, I would lock it to make it especially leak proof.  Happy drinking!!"

My favorite thing about it is how fast you can drink from them. No glugging. The pop top is easy to undo one handed and the carrying ring snaps over the button so it won’t pop open when you don’t want it to.The only problem with these is it develops mold on the mouthpiece seal that you can’t clean off. I have a black line where it seals against the mouthpiece. I would buy a replacement seal if they sold them."

        "title": "Convenient, Great Design, Incredible For Everyday Use",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I love that the bottle has a large capacity (40 oz) but still fits well in backpack bottle holders (if it can hold a 32 oz Nalgene, it can hold the 40 oz Owala). The sipping straw feature built into the mouthpiece is surprisingly comfortable and very easy and convenient to use regardless if you're sipping or swigging. The design of the mouthpiece also makes it very easy to clean compared to other sipping bottles like a bite valve bottle. The stainless steel vacuum interior holds water temperature very well and is very easy to clean, especially with the wide mouth opening when the cap is removed. The cap secures very well and you can feel the tight seal when you close it, giving you confidence that it won't leak. The silicone seal for the mouthpiece also can be removed very easily for cleaning and the carrying handle folds in very well and locks in securely. Everything locks into place with a very satisfying, secure click.The one caveat, or limitation, of the bottle is that the seal on the mouth piece is so effective that it can cause the straw to store water when you remove the cap when the bottle is full. This may lead to some spillage from the end of the straw if the mouthpiece seal is opened after the removal of the straw. Also, when filling the bottle, be sure to replace the cap with the mouthpiece seal open or some water may shoot out of the mouthpiece when you open the seal as the water rushes into the straw when the air is released. In my opinion, this is a very minor issue.Overall, the bottle has quickly become my everyday water bottle. It fits into my bag's bottle pockets very well and is great for leaving on my desk at work to sip water from while also being great to take swigs from while at the gym, or when I'm especially thirsty. The simple design makes it easy to clean and the stainless steel interior holds temperature very well while being plastic free."

        "content": "I LOVE my Owala. Several months ago, I researched for HOURS on the best water bottle to get. I was gifted a Stanley but never liked it much since I'm a germaphobe and don't like the straw being exposed to the elements. A friend recommended her 32oz Owala, but I decided on the 24 since \"filling up more often\" really isn't a concern for me. I've had it for months now and it was definitely a perfect decision. The dual-use sip/chug spout is GENIUS and I definitely make use of both. It is very easy to clean, which i do at least weekly. I also bought a silicone boot to put on it, which I would recommend for anyone who is prone to dropping like me. I took hours to decide on a color, I ended up with the teal/orange/reddish one. Since getting this and using it around campus, I've seen TONS of other students/athletes using owalas, and even specifically in this color. Before a few weeks ago, I have never seen anyone on Tiktok/online/in person ever using this color. Not saying I started it, but...(jk, but definitely get the bottle)"

I am extremely pleased with that cover and the resulting clean tastes of water, but I got so much more with this bottle. It's insulated, which is a bonus. It works so well as a squeeze bottle that I don't even touch my mouth to it, so I don't feel the need to always clean the inside. But if I need to, the cap and nozzle separate into several pieces to make it easy to clean. The lock works absolutely perfectly: can't even squeeze a drop out if I wanted to.

They do keep water cooler longer than my non-insulated ones but on 85-90 degree days after 4 hours, it's not gonna be ice cold. One trick is to fill them a little over 3/4 of the way and set them in the freezer at a slight angle with the cap on loosely. Frozen overnight like this, they are much more effective past the 3-hour mark. I usually freeze two and fill the others with cold water and ice along with my Tailwind Endurance Fuel."

Here are my 2 cents on this Podium insulated bottle by CamelBak:Pros 👍👍👍- Dirt-Proof: This was the selling point for me. I've tried different bottles in the past, including one from Schwinn (see photos 📸) This one worked the best at keeping (most) dust away from the drinking spout 🙌- Locking Function: No Spills, No Squirts and No Surprises!- Overall, really good fit and finish.Cons 👎👎👎- Insulation: It's a good idea on paper but in reality it has limited functionality. That's a nice way of saying, it doesn't really work!- A little pricy.My Recommendation 🤔If you enjoy riding your bike and are tired of eating dirt, this bottle is for you! This bottle has served me very well. If anything, I need another bottle cage and second bottle! Can't wait for the next time it goes on sale!Note on Cleaning 🧴🫧🤔 I've seen one review that shows this bottle can get moldy. That was a little concerning to me but I rinse mine with warm water and dish soap after each ride and let it air dry on a rack. Honestly, I haven't experienced any mold or smell in my bottle. Take that for what it's worth!Hope my short review has helped you make a more informed buying decision 👍😊✌️⚠️ Quick Update (04/19/2023) ⚠️Got my second bottle cage put on and added a second podium bottle (non insulated) for additional hydration 😎 Check out my new photos 📸😅👋"

I purchase this 12 oz and it is perfect. Fits well in my car door and keeps my drinks cold for about 36 to 48 hours. Ice stays for 24 hours or more depending on the outside temp. The metal is easy to clean. The threads and gasket always seal perfectly and the bottle doesn't seem to dent easily. No leaks. I highly recommend it. The navy blue is an excellent color."

        "content": "I received my order two days ago, and I am happy with it. The bottle has a sleek design that fits my hand much better than most of the others I’ve owned. I was disappointed by the size of the bottle opening. It is about an inch and a half wide and I will have to buy a smaller bottle brush to clean it properly. I also couldn't get my smaller ice cubes to fit the narrow opening, so I crushed some ice in the blender. The great news is that the ice stayed frozen for at least ten hours. Today, I didn't feel like chopping ice, so I added some very cold water from my fridge to the bottle, and 6 hours later,  it was still cold. If it's possible to redesign this with a wider mouth, it would be perfect for me. However, if you have a crushed ice option on your fridge or an icemaker with small pellet ice, you should have no problems loading it with ice and enjoying a very cold beverage for several hours. Though, so far, the water in the bottle is still cold, even without any ice. I wrote this review so anyone who must have a wide-mouth bottle understands this particular style may not fit your needs. However, if the narrow opening isn't a deal breaker, this is quite a good bottle that delivers on the promise to keep beverages cold for a reasonable price."

        "content": "I purchased this insulated water bottle primarily because I'm often chilly in my office and enjoy having hot tea to keep me warm.First and foremost, the 750ml size is just perfect for my needs. I always prefer larger sizes because you don't have to refill as often, haha.I'm accustomed to a German brand called \"emsa,\" which is known for keeping water warm for extended periods. I must say that this bottle is comparable in terms of heat retention. It keeps my beverages very hot for 6 hours, still pleasantly warm for 12 hours, and even maintains a noticeable warmth for up to 18 hours.One of the most significant advantages I've experienced is that this bottle has never leaked on me. It's airtight and reliable, which is essential for keeping my bag and belongings dry.A helpful tip for maximizing its heat retention: Before pouring your hot drink inside, add a small amount of hot water, close the lid securely, give it a quick shake, and then empty the water. Afterward, pour your hot drink in. This little trick has made a noticeable difference in how long my drink stays warm.I haven't had the chance to test it with cold drinks, so I can't comment on its performance in that regard."

The inside bottom of the bottle reads SUS 304, which is food grade stainless steel. The cheapest, grey 25oz bottle looks very industrial. Luckily we had some colorful stickers on hand.

Now, I can’t believe I didn’t buy a new one sooner as it so much easier to place in the dishwasher instead of washing and drying by hand. Plus, I love that my dish washer will disinfect (total germaphobe here) the bottle which might mot happen by hand washing. Since  purchasing this 16 Oz bottle, I’ve bought a new 32 Oz to use at home and will either give away or donate my other bottles that aren’t dishwasher safe. My bottle in the color “indigo” and is a beautiful dark blue which is not a navy blue but close. It’s held up so far during a daily trip through the dishwasher.I use this bottle (plus the neoprene sleeve I purchased to fit over it to prevent scratches and light dents) in a backpack or other bags. It’s light weight to carry when full and fits easily into bags, purses and backpacks compared to a 32 Oz . It provides enough water to get you through work (which is what I use it for, we have water dispensers for refills) or I imagine classes for school until you can refill it again. It keeps my water cold and fresh and has no leaks or defects as of now. I can’t recommend it enough but will update if anything changes."

The problem is that to all visual inspection, it can look like the lid is perfectly reassembled . . . but then it will leak between the two main sections.  Then you have to disassemble if someplace where you can do so and try it again.  I'm thinking the rubber gasket is not always seated securely even though it appears to be so.The thermal construction of the metal part is excellent - I have fixed hot tea, then gotten distracted and forgotten to put the lid on and come back an hour later to find the tea still quite hot.  I don't get the 12 hours of truly hot beverage, but I've gotten too rushed to do what one is supposed to for best effectiveness - preheat with hot or boiling water and empty right before adding hot beverage.  That said, my tea is still piping hot two hours later when I first start drinking and acceptably warm and drinkable more than six hours later.  Like it enough that I've gotten two of them."

        "content": "I love this water bottle. The water taste great in it. It is not your typical cheap plastic water bottle. The only thing plastic is the inside of the lid. It is heavy duty. I have dropped it a few times and it held up really well. I don’t have to clean it too frequently since it just water I use in it. It holds about half a gallon of water. I put ice cubes in it and they melted. But it did keep my water cold. It does leak if you don’t fully close the lid. I have had it for a month now and use it every day. It works super well."

        "content": "At my kids' school, the students bring their own water bottles to drink during the day and at P.E. The drinking water from the fountains doesn't taste good to my 10 year old (and now my younger son, too), so he asked if he could get a big jug to bring water from home. If you've lived in Southern California you'll know what I mean. I have a 64 oz. Roamer and love it, so I thought a 40 oz. might work well for him. He absolutely loves it--it fits inside his backpack (he usually only has a couple folders, a chapter book, a jacket, and a lunchbox in there), but it holds lots of water. He used to bring his 18 oz. Yeti AND the S'well Roamer, but now it's just the Roamer. It's got scuffs and scratches, but I've seen him accidentally drop it onto the concrete, and it hasn't dented yet! It's empty when he brings it home, so I know it's getting used. He's asked if he can take my 64 oz, and give his 40 oz to his younger brother, but I don't want to give mine up until there's another sale. This one is definitely a genuine S'well, and doesn't leak, it keeps his water cold, it hasn't come apart or rusted, etc. He loves that he can bring a lot of water with him when we go to the pumpkin patch, or the basketball court, or a day running errands. Cleaning is easy with an OXO bottle brush kit, I use the small round brush to swipe the groove inside the cap. The handle is great not only for picking up the bottle and for carrying, but we can use it to hang on a hook in the car, so that it doesn't roll around on the seat or the floor."

        "content": "I have a 32oz swell that I have had for a few years and love it. My daughter bought it for me and I use it daily.  I was so pleased with it that months after she gave it to me, I bought the 64oz as I sometimes need more tea to get through my day. It wasn't long before the vacuum seal failed. I could see no visible dents but assumed the seal failed due to a drop or bumping it. I was disappointed but eventually bought another and to my dismay it wasn't long before it was no longer keeping things cold either.  I chocked it up to the 640z being too heavy making them easy to damage.  Months after losing a second one due to loss of the seal,  I find myself tempted to buy another.  I love the size and my 32OZ is a champ, but I fear I will be throwing my money away yet again. I would buy another 32, but lugging two around daily would be a chore. Bottom line, it is a great product,  but the large size is heavy and harder to handle."

The mouth is also big enough for a bottle brush to fit comfortably in case you need to do a bit of deep cleaning. This bottle DOES NOT work with the commuter lid. I’ve triedThe handle is a hard plastic so I would be mindful about knocking it on something for fear of breaking it.The lid is as you would expect, does great for insulation too.The bottle itself is a literal jug. If I stretch my hand I could hold it with one hand. I would buy another for myself if I didn’t already have a 20oz commuter.I’d HIGHLY recommend this over other bottles because you absolutely get what you pay for. swell is the only brand I’ve seen that’s triple insulated and it definitely showsBefore anyone thinks I’m sponsored, I’m 100% not. I just really like their products and this, to me, is a one-and-done purchase. I don’t like having 10+ bottles lying around that are all cheap10/10 would buy again"

The S’well takes it in stride and keeps the water icy cold when it is 99° outside (or hotter inside the yoga studio).  The shape is pleasing and the broad base is stable so the S’well never falls over.  I did contact customer service and they totally stand behind the product!"

        "content": "I've had this water bottle for a month now and it works well and purifies the water from the tab, it is easy to refill and makes the water taste better. The first couple of bottles do have a weird plastic taste, but after 4-5 refills that taste disappears. Great value for under $20.00 USD;  Living in Portland Oregon, we have great tasting (sweet) water from the tap... but flouride is added, which is a harmful chemical to the human body which calcifies the pineal gland; I made the purchase to illimnate the flouride in the water I drink.Happy with my decision hope this helps you."

        "content": "I’ve been using these for months now. The only complaint I have with this one is that the dark blue ones hold more water. The one bit of advice I have,is when you clean your bottle out,clean the filter as well. I put lemon in my water & I didn’t clean the filter & it was really hard to drink from. Once I took it all apart, I found lemon guck all over the filter. After I cleaned it, it was easy to drink from again. Even if you clean the filter, the filters only last about a month. I wish they lasted longer. But, like I said, I do love these bottles! They’re super useful & the water tastes great! I just recommend buying the dark blue one, because it holds more water."

I love that you can put it in the side sleeve of your backpack or just carry it with the top handle.

Well, that was a mistake, although I think I got all the pieces back in place, they leak like crazy. The bottles were hard to clean into all the little crevices and I felt that there were moldy spots.Time for a new bottle.....The new bottle has a different mouthpiece and different filter system.  I wasn't sure about the mouthpieces which is place in the middle of the top of the bottle (vs on the edge as on the previous models).  Also when I first started using it, the cover kept hitting my face and I was completely annoyed, only to discover that I had to push it harder to go further back and everything was good again.  Now it moves back easily.  The bottle looks like it will be easier to clean - time will tell.I do like the mouthpiece in the center, not better or worse than the older models.  I do love that you can drink from these bottle so easily and don't have to lean it back to drink."
