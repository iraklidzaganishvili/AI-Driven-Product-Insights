        "content": "I used to play world of warcraft 11 years ago but the game got ahead of my technology. So I had to give it up. in  Facebook group I saw this laptop recommended as a good value for a gaming laptop. I decided to treat myself. I love it! I love how the keyboard lights up, I love how it boots up quickly, the great response in gameplay. The only thing that I do not like about it is the battery life is like 3 hours. I called the acer help desk to see is this is a problem. I was told that this is normal. This is not a problem for me because I do not travel and can plug it in when I need the battery recharged. This might be a problem for other folks."

        "content": "I like the size of the screen and the overall solid feel of the laptop. Its very fast and efficient. The only con Ive found so far is it gets very hot (I do play my game for hours tho)however the built in fans are very effective at the ultra setting and able to cool the laptop down substantially. So far great gaming laptop. Graphics are beautiful BUT screen brightness is lacking a little but not much.Pros- Fast , Efficient, Good Graphics, Loud and clear sound quality.Cons- Temp, Loud fans, Screen could be a tad bit brighter.I got the model that goes for $799 regularly. No regrets with this purchase it does what I wanted it to do."

Would've been worth the price even without the BF discount to be quite honest.Excellent high refresh rate, high resolution monitor. Runs smoothly. The keyboard feels light and good to the touch. Very light for its size and zero noise from the fans."

        "title": "Solid Entry Level Gaming Computer (Detailed)",
        "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "Detailed First Impression ReviewI’ve been on Xbox for a long time for gaming and wanted to see the hype behind PC gaming. I do many things with my computer that a desktop would not work for me, as I have to move it around frequently and like portability, so I explored into the gaming laptop world. This was a cheaper, yet good option for an entry level Device.Processor- I bought the i7-11800H model and this processor seems to be a bit overkill for even some higher end games. But it’s great to have that extra power to multitask as well. I have not had any issues with the processing power. It’s fast and smooth.Graphics- I’m using the RTX-3050Ti and I’ve seen the card likes to run at 100% nearly all the time when in a game but I have had no issues with its capability of running smoothly and not overheating, and I haven’t even tried any undervolting yet which could improve it more.RAM- the 16gb ram and 4gb vram work well together. I use the heavily graphic related game of BeamNG Drive that requires a lot of RAM to run smooth and have tried several multiplayer games and have never seen the RAM get over 70% (which is pretty good for heavily demanding games). This was Plenty of RAM for the gaming I do to keep it running smooth.Overall- this is a great starting laptop for anyone looking for a gaming laptop or something fast for multitasking. Sure there might be a couple other options with similar price ranges that might perform slightly better. But this one was the lowest price I saw for what you get out of it and it’s been working just fine for me. I haven’t had it long so I may be back to update this if my opinion changes lol. But first impressions were really good.Negatives- the graphics card works really great as mentioned above, but if you use it running at 100% for a couple hours you can completely notice a performance drop because the temperature starts to get too hot. I haven’t had it overheat but I have had some slight performance differences after a while of hard use. That’s really the only “issue”, that’s not a huge deal, that I’ve had. And it’s correctable by changing up some deeper settings.As I have mentioned, this is a great ENTRY Level laptop. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone that is heavily into gaming. It works great for what I want to do with it but it would work pretty bad for a professional gamer (not that pros would ever use a laptop for gaming lol). I am also newer to PC gaming but I’m pretty savvy with computers. So being able to change some settings that the average newer user wouldn’t know how to, without YouTube tutorials, have made this laptop perform a little better than out of the box. But these changes I made so far are all settings included on the computer, not third party software included in this review (meaning anyone can change the basic settings to improve the performance slightly as I have).PS- I thought I had a dead laptop when it came like other reviewers complained about. I read the review of one person that said you have to jam the power plug in there really good til it clicks for it to work. I initially thought I pushed hard enough and heard a light snapping sound, but it wouldn’t charge or turn on. So I pushed a lot harder and heard it click a lot louder and it started charging perfectly fine and started up right away."

        "title": "I got a lemon. Returning and eagerly awaiting a second (functional) unit.",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "UPDATE (22 March 2022):New unit arrived yesterday and started up perfectly.As for a laptop, it's perfectly functional. The design is nice, the keyboard feels nice (trackpad takes some getting used to clicking), there are enough ports for the peripherals I use, and it's run older games for 5 hours straight with negligible heat. I haven't tested the webcam and microphone yet.I don't play new or graphic-intensive games, but this ran very well on older games (Team Fortress 2, Spec Ops: The Line, Magic the Gathering 2014) and some newer ones (Deep Rock Galactic). I plan to run Halo Infinite and Outer Wilds later this week and expect it to perform well.I will keep this updated as my time with this computer progresses. 5/5___________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW (20 March 2022):TL;DR - I'm sure the laptop is great but the one I received is defective (can't charge - motherboard issue). I am returning it to Amazon and have ordered another one, as I'm sure a functioning unit will meet my expectations for this product. I will update my review when my second order arrives. As for now, 1 star for defective product.I wanted a budget gaming laptop to replace my retired ASUS G55VW (2011). I chose this model due to its strong specs for a budget device, including an RTX 3050Ti (midrange for graphics cards in 2021 but supports the burgeoning ray-tracing technology used in current games), Core i7 CPU, 1 TB SSD storage, and 16GB memory. I also chose this because I wanted a 17-inch screen. The price point maxed out my acceptable budget range (~$1200).I believe this laptop is a good choice for me considering these specs and the price, and I look forward to trying it out.HOWEVER, the model I received appears to be defective - I believe I got a lemon. Upon unboxing, plugging the charger into the laptop did not illuminate the 'charging' light on the laptop, even after trying different electrical outlets and surge protectors. I took it to a local computer repair shop and the tech confirmed the charger itself was functional, as his voltmeter reported 19+ V. Upon opening the device and testing it, he concluded that something was wrong with the motherboard that prevented charging (I am unfamiliar with computers and cannot relay the significance of what he said).I filed for a return-and-replace with Amazon; they accepted the return but denied the replacement - likely so I couldn't keep both laptops and run. The laptop is currently repackaged and I will drop it off at UPS for a return in the next couple of days.I immediately ordered another unit, as this model was my first choice. I expect the second product to work just fine and meet my purchasing expectations, and eagerly await its arrival. I understand defective products are produced and shipped as a natural part of the production process, and do not consider this representative of Acer.While I'm sure the product will meet my expectations, I am saddened to receive a defective model. I will provide an updated review when my second order arrives."

        "title": "Amazing screen quality and performance at its price, but loud fans and poor speakers",
        "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "The screen was sufficiently bright and could run games pretty well, but the fans were pretty loud and the speakers were kinda meh quality. The build quality of the laptop itself was very impressive, very rugged and durable, and the hinges seem like they would last at least 6-7 years.I found that you could lower the fan sound a little by setting the Power profile of your computer to Balanced, and helping it even further along by setting the display to 60 Hz, but it might require you to use Vertical Sync/VSYNC in some games.  I was able to run Starfield at 100+ FPS on Low, but the fans were blaring at me the entire time. The fact that it also comes with SATA drive support is also very impressive, because most laptops have completely abandoned SATA support for NVME to save space and for slightly better thermal performance. This computer also has 2 fans for improved thermals (weird fact, I know, but some laptops only have 1), but they also generate twice the noise.Aside from that, this is a very solid entry-level gaming laptop and will be able to run modern games at low-medium settings for at least a few years."

        "title": "The Machine is Fine - Build Quality and Support Leaves a Lot to be Desired",
        "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars",
        "content": "I got my computer on February 1st. It had a defective screen. I sent it to Acer. It took them two days to get my a shipping label. It took seven days for it to reach them. After they had it for a week, they could not give me an ETA on when repairs would be finished. I finally got it back today, on the 25th, and immediately returned it to Amazon because I had to have a functional computer and couldn't hold onto my loaner without a solid estimate for when I'd get this one back.So it was nearly a full four weeks from when I originally got it that it was in my hands in a fully working state, and from what I've seen, this is fast for Acer.Which is a shame - this is a lot of computer for the price. To give credit where it's due, I tested the laptop when it was returned to me and it seemed like the screen problems I was having were completely fixed.Considering the price puts this solidly in the mid-range category, you're getting a lot for what you're paying. It doesn't need an additional harddrive or RAM to be completely viable out of the box. (I bought the 1TB/16GB RAM model.) If you want to add a harddrive, there's a SATA cable in the box, and it's fairly easy to get the back panel off. There's even a tutorial by Acer on YouTube on exactly how to do it.In terms of right-to-repair, though, it's mediocre. It's easy to get to the guts of the computer itself. I'd like having easy access panels for the HDD and RAM, but that's a minor complaint - it's not hard to pry this laptop open.What's disappointing is the mount for the screen. Screens die faster than anything else on a laptop. The way this thing is built, I'm not surprised my screen was defective out of the box. You'll want to always open and close the lid with both hands if you want your screen to last the lifetime of the laptop. If you ever need to change the screen out, it's clearly not designed for you to be able to do so. The bezels aren't as simple to pop open as they are on other units, and the screen is held in place by glue, making it so that you probably want to take it to a technician unless you have some experience doing these kinds of repairs yourself.I wish I could say my experience with this was stellar. I loved my Acer Predator Helios from 2018. I've loved the Aspire I've used for writing documents. I'm just completely unimpressed by Acer's service. Three weeks in and no ETA concerning when the laptop would be back in my hands was unacceptable. They only send you updates when they receive your laptop and when they're sending it back. You can't find out any further details - not even where you're at in the queue.I ended up getting a Lenovo Idea Pad 3 Gaming and so far I am loving it. I can't rate Lenovo's support because I haven't had to contact them. The machine I am using now feels rock solid; much better than I would have expected given the amount of power it has for the price. (Under $800.)With this laptop - it looks like it would be worth it if you get it and it works as intended right out of the box. But - I'm far from the only person who has had an issue with it. They've had build quality problems with the Nitro line all the way through, and there are cases where it took 5-6 weeks for people to get their machines back if they went through Acer's support.With these specs, from the testing I did when I had it hooked up to an external monitor, it performs as beautifully as you'd expect. There is a rock solid machine here if you're careful with the screen and get one that works right out of the box.If you don't?Don't deal with Acer support. Buy a third party warranty if you think you'll ever need it. Buying online, I'd go for something without a lot of reported build problems. This is the kind of laptop that I would buy in person so I could test and immediately replace a defective unit.My trust in Acer is completely shot after this experience. At this point, I'm just glad they got it back to me within the return window. I jumped in because I've had amazing experiences with Acer hardware in the past. Those will probably be my last Acer machines. It's completely unacceptable for a multi-million dollar company to mass produce a line of laptops with a high number of defects and a support process that leaves the buyer in the dark for the majority of it.So - based on build quality, it's a 3 1/2 to 4 star laptop if it works. If it doesn't? You're better off returning it and getting another computer."

I don't game much but I've played a few easy going games and have had no actual issues, and will be upgrading to 32GB of RAM just because. My biggest issue is that if you stay on a bright screen for a while, like Amazon for example, and then go to a website where you're using a dark mode, like I do on Discord, the ghost image can be seen. Also, when streaming shows/movies there's always a bright spot in the bottom left corner as if someone is home and forgot to turn the light off in a room. It's distracting."
